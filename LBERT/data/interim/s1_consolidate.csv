2005-11-15,a269980,Cash outflow hits Schroders,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Douglas Bence,A 68% increase in asset management business has driven third quarter profits at Schroders.,"A 68% increase in asset management business has driven third quarter profits at Schroders.
But although growth in the three months to 30 September continued at the rate established over the last three years, profits before tax for the quarter at PS63.6 million are weaker than last year's PS86.5 million because of a one-off gain of PS47.8 million in 2004 from the sale of an unidentified private equity investment in the US.
Although Schroders (SDR) won't spell out the details, chief executive Michael Dobson said it was one of the few successful investments made in the dotcom era.
Profit before tax for the first nine months of the year was PS187.1 million against PS159.1 million. If allowance is made for a PS20.4 million gain from a discontinued outsourcing contract, the profits come down to PS166.7 million.
Asset Management revenues for the quarter were PS141.2 million against PS103.9 million. Costs were up to PS95.1 million from PS76.4 million, while profit was PS46.1 million against PS27.5 million, around 10% higher than the market estimated.
This is a result of what Dobson called a 'good tail wind on equities' and improvements in group revenue and operating margins which rose to 32.6% in the third quarter from 31.4% in the first half.
'The core business is playing a key role in driving the profitability of the group, as it should' he said. The core fund management division accounted for 78% of underlying group profits over the nine months against 51% in the same 2004 period.
Private banking revenue for the quarter was PS17 million against PS16.3 million. Costs increased from PS13.8 million to PS15.5 million while profit fell PS1 million to PS1.5 million.
Group funds under management rose 5.5% in the three months to PS118.3 billion, in line with Citigroup's forecast. There was a net business outflow of PS2.1 billion, PS1.2 billion on the institutional side and PS900 million from fund manager changes.
Although both Citigroup and Merrill Lynch said the third quarter results were better than expected - Citigroup was expecting PS42 million and Merrill 46.4 million - the market otherwise saw the outflow as both disappointing and larger than expected and this accounts for the 13.5p fall in Schroders' shares to 879p.
Schroders is still looking for acquisitions. These could be in the US, but Dobson wouldn't say if there were any imminent deals although he did say that there are currently 'more opportunities around than we have seen in the past'.
Numis analyst Stuart Duncan is upgrading his forecasts for 2005 and 2006 by 12% and 11% respectively. He expects profit before tax for 2005 PS215.8 million and PS229.4 million in 2006 and upgrades the shares from 'hold' to 'add'. Citigroup retains its 'buy' recommendation while Merrill Lynch is 'neutral'.Although Dobson is keen that pundits do not underestimate the importance of Schroders' investment strategy, the key to the shares is the higher margins coming from the growth funds. This is a result of the group's determination to grow its top line. The shares have outperformed the market over 12 months rising from 681p. A good share to buy for the medium term particularly if today's weakness prevails.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/cash-outflow-hits-schroders/a269980,1
2006-02-20,a271779,JO Hambro to launch new European fund after soft closures,Liquidation of a fund,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Dylan Lobo,JO Hambro plans to unleash a new continental European product after soft closing its Dublin-based European and Continental European funds to new investors.,"JO Hambro plans to unleash a new continental European product after soft closing its Dublin-based European and Continental European funds to new investors.
The new JOHCM Continental Select Values fund will be managed by Willem Vinke, who currently manages the firm's PS97 million JOHCM European Select Values fund, which is also domiciled in Dublin.
The group was unable to provide any more comment on the vehicle and said further details would be announced in early March.
The move to soft close the funds was in line with the group's previously stated policy that it will cap funds in order to protect the managers' ability to achieve consistent outperformance.
Rod Marsden, who jointly runs the fund with Paul Wild, feels that export strength, government spending and an improvement in the consumer environment will continue to support Europe this year.
According to Lipper, JOHCM Continental European fund has returned 80.2% since its launch in November 2001 versus a 41.4% gain in its FTSE Eurofirst 300 ex-UK benchmark.
Meanwhile, the JOHCM European fund has returned 82.6% since its launch in May 2003.
The group will soft close the funds by exploiting Dublin legislation, which effectively allows the directors to use their discretion to turn away new business.
The combined target of the funds is PS500 million. The total currently stands at PS470 million and existing investors will be able to trade as normal in the fund until it reaches the target. After that existing investors will be restricted to trades of PS25,000 a day.
Richard Meyrick, sales director at JO Hambro, explained: 'In long periods of outperformance more money follows the fund managers and they have to change their investment style as a result. Soft closing the fund should give the managers every chance of outperforming.'
He also pointed out that the fund managers have further incentive to do well as they get a 15 basis points performance fee for every 1% of outperformance.
JO Hambro soft closed its JOHCM Japan fund, run by Scott McGlashan, last year after assets in the vehicle soared to PS250 million in just 11 months after launch.
The group has also stated it will cap Clive Beagles' JOHCM UK Equity Income fund, which currently holds PS250 million, when it hits its target of PS750 million.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/jo-hambro-to-launch-new-european-fund-after-soft-closures/a271779,0
2011-04-26,a488160,Hugh Young 'relaxed' about underperformance,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Philip Haddon,Veteran Aberdeen Asia Pacific fund manager Hugh Young thinks a slowdown in the region is 'healthy' and is not concerned by his recent underperformance.,"Hugh Young of Aberdeen thinks a slowdown in Asian growth is healthy and is not concerned by his recent underperformance.
Young, who is head of global equities and managing director of Aberdeen's Asian business, says he is relaxed about underperforming in the past six months and puts it down, on the country side, to India underperforming the likes of Australia.
'We have given back a chunk of the last year's outperformance, it has been a weak six months in total now but I am relaxed,' the respected manager of the Aberdeen Asia Pacific Equity fund said. 'We do expect periods of underperformance, it is nothing dramatic. Our one year performance is still strong.'
Indeed, in the past six months the widely-followed Aberdeen Global - Asia Pacific Equity fund has returned 4.3% while the MSCI Asia Pacific ex Japan index has risen 9.8% in dollar terms. However, over one year the fund has delivered 19.8% while the index has risen 18.4%.
Speaking from his Singapore base, Young - who was recently profiled in Citywire Global magazine - said country allocation contributed to his funds' recent performance drag.
'Places like India, where we are heavy in, have underperformed. The same goes for Singapore, while the likes of Australia have done well,' he said, adding that some long-held stock favourites such as Jardine Strategic Holdings have also disappointed.
There have been few changes overall to Young's portfolio in recent months, with the biggest change being the purchase of a stock he has not held in ten years: HSBC. 'There is evidence of change within HSBC, it is going back to its Asian roots, and it has an exceptionally strong business here. It's done the tidying up from some ill-advised acquisitions, and we have a 1.5% position with it now in the fund.'
Looking at valuations in the region, Young does not think they are excessively high.
'I don't think valuations are stretched. Historic P/E ratios range from 9 times earnings to 20 times. We're in a no man's land at the moment. They're not stretched at around 13 times, but neither are they particularly cheap,' he said.
He understands why there has been a shift in sentiment towards the region, saying it is a 'natural reaction'.
'The reason is a concern about inflation and higher interest rates in Asia. We won't be surprised to see higher interest rates percolating through the system through the rest of the year and other tightening measures.'
However, he said the Asian slowdown is healthy and positive sentiment towards the developed world could be overdone.
'We are seeing a slowdown, I think that's quite healthy. After a strong rebound last year, earnings wont be as strong this year. We're expecting economic growth to be 1% less this year than last year. But we're not great believers in the recovery of the West story; we're a bit sceptical.'",https://citywire.com/selector/news/hugh-young-relaxed-about-underperformance/a488160,3
2011-04-27,a488963,Carmignac 'stands firm' over underperformance,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Atholl Simpson,The giant French group's two biggest funds have seen three quarters of underperformance but the firm says the market is finally starting to justify its stance.,"Carmignac Gestion's two largest funds, Patrimoine and Investissement, have experienced three consecutive quarters of underperformance but the firm said it would rather that than navigating 'the minefields' of investing in Europe.
Over the past nine months the Patrimoine fund has lost 3.7% while its benchmark has risen 2.1%. Over the same period the Investissement fund has returned 2.6% compared to its benchmark's rise of 12.4%.
The firm's spokesperson and investment committee member, Didier Saint-Georges, told Citywire the reason behind the funds' extended period of underperformance was the firm's stance on the equity sector in Europe and emerging markets.
However, Saint-Georges stood by the firm's decision to maintain a low equity exposure to Europe over recent months while other fund managers were moving back into the region as fears over its sovereign debt problems started to diminish.
'Our great defiance over Europe's sovereign debt problem and our belief in the positive outlook for emerging markets are convictions upon which we stand firm.
'Europe is a minefield. You can have major problems that appear in many different places, like Greece or Ireland, but at times the market can manage to navigate between them. But as a manager we have to ask ourselves if we can do the same. I prefer to underperform for a period of time than navigate this minefield and expose our funds to high risk.'
The French firm believed at the start of 2010 that Europe's sovereign debt was the main market risk for the year ahead and its two biggest funds, the EUR8 billion Carmignac Investissement run by the group's founder and star manager Edouard Carmignac and the EUR22 billion Carmignac Patrimoine run by Carmignac, Rose Ouahba and Frederic Leroux, were both positioned accordingly.
Although the group's fund managers acknowledged the inflation issue in the emerging markets was real, they believed the region's financial leaders had a firm grip on it.
'But the market did not have that feeling and felt that the EU debt was not a problem while the emerging countries were going to slow down because of the necessary tightening of their monetary policy.'
Following this period, Saint-Georges said that the market has begun turning around to the firm's global view since the end of February.
'The market is starting to realise that the big inflation scare was due mainly to food inflation and the side effects of QE2. Food inflation peaked in March and is now going down and QE2 will soon be over.
'The peak of inflation in emerging markets is taking place and in the second quarter we will have deceleration.'
Although Saint-Georges said the group stands firm on its equity convictions and its bullish stance on emerging markets, the Patrimoine and Investissement funds have changed their currency exposure in favour of the euro following its recent outperformance against the dollar.
At the end of 2010 the Patrimoine fund had just 25% exposure to the euro and 41% to the dollar, but at the end of March it had 59% in the euro and only 12.3% in the US dollar.
'At the current price, despite the problems of the euro and the region's sovereign debt, we have to recognize that the euro can still outperform the dollar,' Saint-Georges said.
'The ECB is helping to ring fence the weaker European countries while tightening its monetary policy, which justifies lowering the dollar exposure in the porfolios.
'Even if it is an economic abberation, the ECB's economic policy is a very 'euro bull' tactic but we remain very vigilant on the impact it can have on the economies of the European peripheral countries.'
Over the last five years Carmignac Patrimoine has returned 34.7% while its benchmark, LCI MSCI World Free/Citigroup WGBI TR (50:50), has risen 11% and the Carmignac Investissement fund has returned 36.3% while its benchmark, MSCI AC World, has risen 1.2%.",https://citywire.com/selector/news/carmignac-stands-firm-over-underperformance/a488963,5
2011-10-17,a533282,Bill Gross admits 'mea culpa' over Total Return underperformance,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,Too little risk off and too much risk on' - the world's largest bond investor takes the rap for a 'bad year'.,"Veteran bond manager Bill Gross has issued a candid apology to investors for the recent underperformance of his $242 billion Pimco Total Return fund.
Publishing a special edition note, entiteld 'Mea Culpa', the bond manager confessed that he had had a 'bad year' underestimating debt difficulties in both the US and the eurozone.
Gross wrote: 'As Europe's crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling debacle turned developed economies toward a potential recession, the Total Return Fund had too little risk off and too much risk on.'
In addition, Gross also touched upon his much-publicised decision to move out of US Treasuries earlier in the year, which he said was 'a little over blown in the press'.
Gross said moves into Canadian Treasuries and German bunds had not countered being underweight in US Treasuries - which had out-performed as investors sought out safe havens.
However, Gross - who last week piled into mortgage-backed securities - said he and his team would work hard to overturn the period of poor performance.
'There is no quit in me or anyone else on the Pimco premises. The early morning and even midnight hours have gone up, not down, to match the increasing complexity of global financial markets,' said Gross.
Looking ahead, Gross said Pimco was predicting zero growth in developed economies over the next several quarters. This, he said, would be factored into the portfolio construction of the Total Return fund.
Over the year-to-date, the Total Return fund has achieved 0.25% total return compared to the benchmark, Barclays Capital US Aggregate Bond TR, which has achieved 5.26% over the same period.",https://citywire.com/selector/news/bill-gross-admits-mea-culpa-over-total-return-underperformance/a533282,4
2012-08-23,a613216,US equity star Holliman defends underperformance,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,The Polar Capital manager refuses to change his approach due to valuation concerns.,"Euro Stars A-rated manager Andrew Holliman has pinned his fund's recent underperformance on its lack of exposure to defensive sectors but stands firm on his current allocation as he believes these are just short-term expensive bets.
Holliman, who runs the Polar Capital North American Fund, used his latest market commentary to explain to investors why his fund currently lags the S&P 500 benchmark.
Since launching the $284 million Polar Capital North American fund in November 2011, Holliman and co-manager Richard Wilson have returned 10.3% in US dollar terms while the fund's Citywire benchmark, the S&P 500, rose 12.1%.
'In July, the best performing sectors were telecoms, energy, consumer staples and utilities. With the exception of energy, the leading sectors were all defensive in nature, and all other cyclical sectors underperformed the index,' said Holliman, who joined Polar Capital from Threadneedle in May last year.
'Given the aforementioned strength in telecoms and utilities, the fund suffered as a result of not having exposure to these sectors, where valuations have become even more stretched. As a result, we are not minded to add exposure here.'
On a sector-by-sector basis, Holliman's preference for cyclical over defensive names has seen him mainly invest in consumer discretionary stocks, where he has a 9% overweight compared to the MSCI North American Index, and IT, where he has a 5% overweight.
Conversely he has zero exposure in telecoms, utilities and materials, while running a 10.6% underweight in energy.
In terms of stock rotation, Holliman insists he is not sitting still. Over July, he replaced three stocks in the 50 stock portfolio, selling out of positions in clinical laboratory firm LabCorp, private equity firm Blackstone Group and railroad owner and operator CSX.
These were sold to make way for new positions in banking and payments specialist Fidelity Information Systems, telecommunications firm Comcast and toymaker Mattel.
'Although some traditionally defensive areas of the market such as utilities, consumer staples and telecoms are becoming expensive it is still possible to find very good value in attractive franchises that should be able to expand return on capital and deliver attractive business value creation even if the global economy continues to slow.'
The new additions to the fund are relatively minor positions, with Holliman's major holdings being in Apple (5.4%), Comcast's parent company Time Warner (3.5%), Microsoft and Pfizer (both 3.1%).",https://citywire.com/selector/news/us-equity-star-holliman-defends-underperformance/a613216,5
2013-07-18,a692321,Aberdeen's Kaloo defends 'unusual' underperformance,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,Emerging markets star counts the cost of Turkish and Brazilian bets in $12bn GEM strategy.,"Significant overweights to Turkey and Brazil have led to the recent underperformance of Aberdeens's $12 billion emerging market equity fund, according to its lead manager Devan Kaloo.
On an investor conference call, Kaloo, who heads up a team responsible for a total of 13 emerging market strategies, said he felt compelled to explain an 'unusual' period of underperformance for the fund.
Kaloo said the fund, which was soft-closed earlier this year, was lagging its benchmark by around one percentage point over the past three months, having lost 8.65% over this period.
However, the Euro Stars AA-rated fund manager has said he has made no major changes to the Aberdeen Global - Emerging Markets Equity fund and, in fact, topped up holdings in two Turkish banks.
Explaining the fund's current positioning, Kaloo highlighted two issues:
'We have had more money, or we have been overweight, in the countries which have seen the biggest sell-off in their currencies, so places like Brazil and Turkey,' he said.
'On the flipside to that, we have been underweight to the countries which have controlled currencies or fixed currencies, such as China and Taiwan. So certainly currency weakness has been a major issue for us and has fed through to weaker performance.'
In addition, Kaloo said he had not managed to offset the negative impact of currency weakness with stock selection in the 65-stock portfolio.
'Here there are a couple of issues, firstly many of the stocks that did very well for us in the first quarter and at the end of 2012, sold off very sharply as people took profits or sold down positions that had done well.'
Financials stocks, which make up 35% of his fund, had been particularly hard hit, Kaloo said.
For example, his holdings in Mexican firm Banorte (2.3%), Brazilian financials firm Bradesco (3.3%) and Turkish bank Akbank (2.1%) were among his poorest performing stocks.
However, Kaloo said the recent underperformance would not force him to make major changes to the portfolio.
'What have we been doing? Not a lot. We have been topping up positions where value has appeared,' Kaloo said. 'We added to our Turkish banks after the protests and the big sell offs.'
This has seen him add to positions in Garanti Bank and Akbank, while also topping up positions in Korean convenience store E-Mart and Russian supermarket chain Magnit.
Kaloo said he had not opted to make any significant position reductions in the fund but had funded these top ups by trimming various holdings.
The Aberdeen Global - Emerging Markets Equity fund has returned 27.31% in the three years to the end of June 2013. This compares to an 11.57% rise by its Citywire benchmark, the MSCI EM (Emerging Markets) TR USD.",https://citywire.com/selector/news/aberdeen-s-kaloo-defends-unusual-underperformance/a692321,2

According to the firm's interim statement healthy inflows were seen during the period, with net subscriptions reaching $1.9 billion (PS1.08 billion) but this was largely offset by $1.3 billion of fund depreciation. This left AUM at $20.5 billion at the end of September, down from $21 billion on 30 June 2008.
Assets in long/short funds were hit hardest, falling from $15.8 billion in June to $15.4 billion in September, while assets in long-only funds were marginally more resilient remaining at 15.1% over the period.
Performance fees for the period stood at $4.9 million.
Bluebay's chief executive, Hugh Willis, put the quarter's losses down to deteriorating market conditions which offset the strong net inflows from institutional investors over the quarter.
He expects extreme market conditions in September and October to date to disrupt net inflows to the asset management industry in the short term and to continue to make it challenging to generate performance fees.
He said: 'Against this, it is probable that such extreme conditions will have the effect of accelerating the point at which the credit cycle turns. While recognising the challenges that will continue to exist in the short term, we remain focused on ensuring that we are well positioned for the exceptional cyclical opportunity in credit markets, which we believe will begin during the course of this financial year.'
Despite the contraction of AUM, Bluebay was up 2.5% at 177p.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/bluebay-sees-assets-fall-2-3-in-deteriorating-market-conditions/a317645,0
2018-10-17,a1166147,AAA-rated China PM: what drove my Q3 downturn,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Sam Benstead,"Tiffany Hsiao explains why government policy, not the trade war, is to blame for recent struggles.","Tiffany Hsiao has pinned recent underperformance on policy missteps by the Chinese government.
Hsiao saw Matthews Asia China Small Companies fund drop into the bottom five of the 149-strong Equity - Greater China sector for its three month returns to the end of September 2018.
Hsiao told Citywire Selector: 'Our underperformance in the last quarter was not to do with the global external environment, but instead because of mistakes that were committed by the Chinese government.
'In the consumer area they started policies on how many hours a day your children are allowed to play video games, as well as what type of video games. Also they introduced policies on how many hours a week children can go to after-school tutoring and put a cap on what cremation services can charge.'
Government micromanagement has caused stocks in educational provider sectors to plummet, with some companies loosing half their value, according to Hsiao.
However, Hsiao does not think that this government attitude will be permanent. 'At the end of the day the Chinese government needs to learn that it can make good policies on money.
'But, it's very hard to make good policy on human beings. They will learn that overtime,' she said.
Enforcing these policies will also be challenging, as Hsiao learned on a recent trip to Shanghai. She said the impact on company performance will be muted.
'I just came back from Shanghai two weeks ago and I visited a lot of these companies and there is absolutely no impact. Math is now called ""logical thinking"", Chinese is now called ""debate class"" and English is now called ""theatre"". They just changed the titles of the courses,' she said.
'There is damage being done on the stock price because before the industries were growing rapidly and had very little policy risk, and now there is the fear that the government may intervene. I think over time people will realise that the actual impact is very minimal.'

Value-focused investment group Sanditon Asset Management is to shut down less than six years after launch, having struggled to attract investors to its funds.
The PS306 million Sanditon European fund, the group's largest, is to transfer to rival fund group Crux Asset Management.
Management of the fund will switch from Sanditon founders Chris Rice and Tim Russell to Crux founder Richard Pease and James Milne. The fund will be rebranded Crux European Opportunities.
Hargreaves said it was dropping the fund from the Wealth 50, which already features Pease's PS1.7 billion Crux European Special Situations fund.
'We feel it's prudent to remove the fund from the Wealth 50,' said senior investment analyst Kate Marshall.
'Pease also currently runs another fund on the Wealth 50 and we don't feel both funds are needed on the list.'
Julie Dean's PS22 million Sanditon UK Select fund will also transfer to Cruc, with Jamie Ward handed the reins and the fund rebranded as Crux UK Opportunities.
The fund group's PS40 million Sanditon Investment Trust (SIT) is set to wind up, with Sanditon Asset Management directors, who hold 22% of the shares, having indicated they will vote against continuation at the next annual general meeting.
Sanditon said it would make alternative arrangements for the PS111 million Sanditon European Select and PS25 million Sanditon UK Select funds.
Sanditon's value-focused approach has struggled since the fund group's launch.
The group's Sanditon European fund has returned 53% over five years, placing it in the bottom half of the Investment Association's Europe excluding UK sector. The European Select fund is down 11% over the same period, kept off the bottom of the Targeted Absolute Return fund only by the Merian UK Opportunities fund.
Over three years, the Sanditon UK fund is up 3.5% and the UK Select fund has fallen 8%, with both towards the bottom of their respective UK All Companies and Targeted Absolute Return Sectors.
Shares in Sanditon Investment Trust have traded below their 2014 launch price of 100p for the last two years, though they jumped from 81p to 86p on news of the wind-up.
Sanditon chief executive Rupert Tyer said he was frustrated by the decision to close the business.
'While we are profitable as a business and have PS500 million in assets under management, we were unable to convince investors to invest in uncorrelated investment strategies that would benefit portfolios. If you look at fund flows in the industry, they are pretty concentrated,' he said.
'Once the board of Sanditon had made the decision that they were unlikely to grow profitably over the next few years, our sole focus was to find an efficient and timely solution to ensure that investors were not disadvantaged in any way.'
Crux director Mark Little said the transfer of the two Sanditon funds was a 'sound solution for investors'.
'The Crux European and UK investment teams have a demonstrable long-term track record of delivering excellent returns for investors,' he said.
Tutman, administrator of the funds, said : 'Our focus has been on achieving a good outcome for our investors, and we are pleased to effect a no-cost, seamless transition from one management group to another. Both firms have identical target markets, similar styles and culture.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/hargreaves-drops-sanditon-from-wealth-50-as-fund-group-to-close/a1283778,14
2020-02-28,a1328525,Jupiter suffers PS4.5bn outflow blow on Darwall exit,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Dylan Lobo,"Profitability at Jupiter was impacted by the outflow in its European equity franchise, which offset a turn in sentiment towards its top bond strategy.","Jupiter Fund Management suffered a PS4.5bn net outflow in 2019 following the exit of top European fund manager Alexander Darwall.
In its full-year results the fund firm revealed PS4.3bn of the outflow came from the European Growth strategy following Darwall's (pictured) departure to set up his own boutique.
In a major sell off across markets amid fears over a coronavirus global pandemic, shares in Jupiter has lost 7% to stand at 303p at 11.15am, more than double the 3% fall on the FTSE.
The overall PS4.5bn outflow, which was a PS0.1bn decrease on the previous year, impacted headline figures at Jupiter with statutory pretax profit down 16% to PS151m for the year and net management fees 6% lower at PS370m. Assets under management were static, ending the year on PS42.8bn.
Chief executive Andrew Formica drew comfort from the turn in sentiment in its Dynamic Bond fund, which had been the major driver of outflows in the previous year. The fund, managed by Ariel Bezalel, saw positive flows across all regions, achieving a total gross flow of PS13.4bn.
Earlier this month Jupiter struck a PS370m deal to acquire Merian Global Investors, which Formica believes will strengthen its business and support future growth, ultimately delivering stronger returns to shareholders.
'When the opportunity arose to acquire Merian Global Investors, the strategic benefits of doing so were clear; Merian's product range could help plug investment capability gaps and contribute to building scale in existing strategies,' he said.
'[The acquisition] would also take us into new areas such as global systematic equities, broaden our institutional client base and consolidate our presence in key international markets,' Formica told the market.
Jupiter cancelled its 2019 special dividend as a consequence of the deal, although Formica stressed the fund firm remains committed to returning surplus capital to shareholders. The decision meant the total dividend for the year was 40% lower at 17.1p.
Formica (pictured), who took leadership of Jupiter last March, described 2019 as resilient one for the year and looked forward to helping the business realise its full potential.
'I was excited to be given the opportunity to help the business realise its full potential. My strategy is to build on the successful legacy of those who went before me to secure Jupiter's long-term future and profitability. The announcement of our proposed acquisition of Merian Global Investors is an important step in this direction.' Formica said.
'Jupiter is only able to embark on this next phase in its journey because the business continued in 2019 to maintain a track record of strong investment outperformance despite volatile markets, difficult industry conditions and internal challenges caused by the succession of a leading fund manager.'
Formica added that investment in technology would be a key focus for Jupiter this year.
'Achieving the best client outcomes drives our technology investment. We implemented a new client relationship management system and are looking at using technology in other ways to support our client service,' he said.

The fund has been dogged by several years of poor performance and has tumbled 42% in 2020, the heaviest losses of any fund in the Investment Association's sectors. Over three years the fund is down 54%, also ranking as the worst performance across funds in all sectors.
In a letter to investors, ASI said the largest investor had 'confirmed their intention to redeem their shareholding' which constituted a 'substantial proportion' of the fund's assets.
According to Morningstar, the fund's largest investors at the end of June were ASI's own MyFolio funds, which held PS42.6m of the fund's PS48.6m assets. ASI declined to comment.
Andrew Hunt was dropped as manager of the fund earlier this year and replaced by Wes McCoy. That move prompted Premier Miton, which had held a PS12.8m stake in the fund, to sell. 'Given the disappointment we had with this holding, this action proved the straw that broke us,' the fund group said at the time.
The closure marks an ignominious end for the fund, which was launched in March 2009 at the very bottom of the financial crisis and enjoyed blistering early performance under the stewardship of David Cumming. He later quit the firm in 2017 to become Aviva's chief investment officer.
The letter confirming the fund's closure said: 'We are writing to notify you of our decision to close the ASI UK Recovery Equity fund on 22 October 2020. The largest investor has confirmed their intention to redeem their shareholding in the fund, which constitutes a substantial proportion of the assets of the fund.
'Following consideration of the available options, we believe it is in the best interest of all shareholders to close the fund, liquidate all of the underlying assets and return the proceeds to investors.'
This is the second sub-scale ASI closed since the beginning of the year. In April the group shut its PS22m Euro Corporate Bond fund after its largest investor redeemed their entire allocation.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/asi-shuts-uk-s-worst-fund-as-major-backer-loses-patience/a1391672,3
2020-10-30,a1419479,Credit Suisse to restructure underperforming alts funds,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Margaryta Kirakosian,"Group aims to achieve CHF50m in savings in 2021, more than half of the overall target for its international wealth management unit.","Credit Suisse has revealed that the challenges posed by Covid-19 have led to the underperformance of a number of its alternative strategies.
On its third quarter call, Credit Suisse's group CEO, Thomas Gottstein, said the firm is restructuring some of these funds, which will incur one-time costs and losses. 'We are targeting gross savings of CHF50m in 2021,' he said.
During the same call, David Mathers, chief financial officer, clarified that this number represents more than half of the costs savings planned for the whole of the international wealth management unit.
He added that the primarily US-based alternatives business has had a much more difficult experience than the group's traditional funds.
'It's continued to suffer from several factors: first, adverse performance in certain of the businesses and the strategies we're invested in; second, from a delay in placement revenues; and finally, I'd remind you that the third quarter of last year included a significant realisation in our alternative business that benefited the third quarter results and has not been repeated this quarter,' Mathers said.
Mathers said Credit Suisse continued to recover the credit investment losses from the first quarter, but this had been offset by a further deterioration of CHF21m in the firm's investments in real estate funds, which again took place within the US business.
Mathers said, despite setbacks within alternatives, the traditional fund business has experienced growth, specifically within thematic equity, fixed income and index funds, which attracted CHF5bn of combined inflows.
Gottstein added that the asset manager now has two-thirds of its assets in alternative or alternative-light and one-third in more traditional and index products. One of the better performers in the alternatives space he highlighted was Credit Suisse's Credit Investments Group.
Gottstein also emphasised that the firm doesn't intend to do any M&A in asset management at this stage. 'Overall, we feel we have the right strategy with being more alternative and alternative-light focused,' Gottstein said.
He added that the firm continues to see opportunities, including significant growth potential of alternatives and private markets, giving its multi-billion private credit partnership with the Qatar Investment Authority as an example.
'I think we're well positioned. 2020 is a little bit of a transition year,' Gottstein said.",https://citywire.com/selector/news/credit-suisse-to-restructure-underperforming-alts-funds/a1419479,1
2021-05-21,a1510498,Nordic group drops ESG from global and EM fund names,Drop in ESG score,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,DNB rebrands strategies to better align with demands set out by SFDR.,"DNB Asset Management is to rebrand its Global ESG and Global Emerging Markets ESG funds in order to better reflect the investment approaches in the wake of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).
The Nordic group announced a raft of changes to funds as part of a prospectus update planned for 7 June 2021. The most notable is the decision to drop overt mention of ESG from two funds previously marketed on that basis.
The DNB Global ESG fund will become the DNB Future Waves fund. The overall emphasis of the fund, which focuses on investing in companies with strong environmental and social characteristics, remains in place.
However, DNB said the change allows it to better align with the demands set out by Article 8 of the SFDR. Article 8 funds overtly promote environmental and/or societal characteristics but, crucially, do not have them as an overarching theme. Audun Wickstrand Iversen will remain as lead manager.
Similarly, ESG is to be removed from the name of the DNB Global Emerging Markets ESG fund, which will be called DNB Emerging Markets Equities. This is again to reflect the fact that, while it does have characteristics that focus on environmental and social aspects, it is not the overarching theme.
Other changes being implemented by the group are designed to better reflect the genuine investment intent of its funds. For example, the DNB Asian Small Cap fund is to be rebranded as the DNB Asian Mid Cap fund, due to its focus areas, while the DNB TMT Absolute Return fund is to be called the DNB TMT Long/Short Equities fund.
The use of 'absolute return' in fund names has proven controversial in the past. DNB was fined in early 2019 for using 'absolute return' in its fund titles. This followed a regulatory clampdown on the use of certain terms in fund marketing, including 'eco' and 'superfonden'.","https://citywire.com/selector/news/nordic-group-drops-esg-from-global-and-em-fund-names/a1510498

Christopher 'Chris' Anderson left the firm on Friday, a Franklin Templeton spokesperson confirmed. As a result, he has come off the $21.8bn Franklin Growth fund.
According to Morningstar, Anderson was added to the fund in early 2020, after the Franklin Select US Equity fund, which then had about $105m in assets, was absorbed into the larger strategy, a process that was approved in mid-2019.
Anderson previously worked for Blum Capital Partners, Fox Paine and Co. and Goldman Sachs, and his LinkedIn profile indicates that he joined Franklin Templeron full-time in 2012.
The spokesperson said that Anderson left the San Mateo, California-based firm 'to pursue another opportunity outside the asset management industry.'
Serena Perin Vinton, who also previously managed the Select US Equity fund, and Robert Rendler remain on the fund, which was not expected to undergo any substantial shifts in investment approach.
The fund launched in 1948 and has been led for 13 years by Perin Vinton. As co-manager, Rendler's focus has been on industrials and natural resources, while Anderson has added specialization in business and insurance, according to a Morningstar note from March by analyst Claire Butz.
The fund's recent performance has been mixed during Perin Vinton's tenure, Butz noted, emphasizing that the fund has underweighted big tech companies such as Tesla, Microsoft and Apple: 'The strategy has struggled to out-perform its Russell 1000 Growth Index category benchmark, though it outpaced its S&P 500 prospectus benchmark and edged its typical large-growth category peer.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/franklin-pm-leaves-firm-and-drops-equity-growth-funds/a1535243?re=87555&ea=1735690&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,5

2021-08-18,a1543677,Managing partner Boris Collardi to exit Pictet,News at organisational level,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Margaryta Kirakosian,The senior manager will be leaving the firm a year after the Swiss regulator put him under scrutiny for his tenure as CEO of Julius Baer.,"Boris Collardi, one of seven current managing partners at Pictet, is leaving the firm on 1 September 2021, the group has announced.
Collardi joined the firm in November 2017 from rival Swiss investment company Julius Baer, where he was CEO at the time.
portfolio manager Elif Aktug and Francois Pictet will become new members of the board of partners following Collardi's departure.
This brings the overall number of managing partners to eight, and will mean Aktug stepping back from her EUR2.5bn market-neutral strategy.
Collardi came under scrutiny in February 2020 following a Finma investigation, which exposed systemic failures in his former employer Julius Baer's anti-money laundering oversight between 2009 and 2018.
In an interview with Neue Zurcher Zeitung am Sonntag at the time, Pictet partner Renaud de Planta said the managing parter had the bank's support.
'We are fully behind Boris Collardi - this applies to all managing partners, and I think I can also speak for the bank's employees,' he said.
In June and July 2020 Swiss prosecutors reportedly looked into two anonymous tips alleging misconduct by Collardi while he was CEO at Julius Baer. He was reprimanded by Swiss authorities in January 2021 as a result but faced no further penalties.
During his tenure with Pictet, Collardi was also co-head of the firm's global wealth management group together with Marc Pictet. A spokesperson confirmed the firm will not be looking for Collardi's replacement in the role.
Collardi was focusing on Asia, a key growth market for the Swiss bank. In the interview with Neue Zurcher Zeitung am Sonntag, de Planta said the group wanted 15-20% of its customers to come from Asia by the end of this decade, a significant increase from its current amount of 10%.
Commenting on Collardi's departure, de Planta said: 'The group will continue expanding its presence in Asia and other priority markets, growing its leading alternative assets capabilities and significantly investing in technology.'
The announcement of Collardi's exit was part of the Pictet half-year group results released today, which showed operating income of CHF 1.54m (EUR1.43m) , a 16% increase compared to the first half of 2020 and a consolidated net profit of CHF 636m, a 142% increase compared with the same period last year.
Pictet said net results include gains from the sale and lease back transaction on its main building in Geneva during the first quarter of the year. The proceeds from this will allow the firm to self-finance the expansion of its headquarters, with the construction of a new building in Geneva planned for 2025.",https://citywireselector.com/news/managing-partner-boris-collardi-to-exit-pictet/a1543677?re=88321&ea=1735690&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,5

The new fund is available for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific investors and will be managed by AAA-rated Hamish Chamberlayne (pictured) and Aaron Scully, alongside a dedicated analyst team and the broader governance and responsible investor team.
They will be supported by a new and growing global team of ESG specialists, led by Janus Henderson's head of ESG investments, Paul LaCoursiere.
The fund will classified as Article 9 in line with Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and has sustainability as its core investment objective.
It will apply positive screening criteria, based on environmental and social themes, as well as negative screening to avoid companies with goods or services that harm the environment or society.
The new fund will draw on the experience of the Janus Henderson Global Sustainable Equity strategy, which had $3.5bn (EUR2.95bn) at the end of June.
Hamish Chamberlayne, head of global sustainable equities at the firm, said: 'The Horizon US Sustainable Equity fund will invest in US companies that are positioned to confront the challenges posed by global megatrends, such as climate change, resource constraints, population growth and ageing populations, and those companies seeking to effect positive transformation in the industries in which they operate.'

The investment team will use a thematic framework to select investments, which will align to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and derive at least 50% of their revenues from the fund's sustainable technology themes.
Clode said: 'While global regulation and classification initially concentrated on environmental sustainability, this fund is looking to go much further and expand to incorporate much wider social issues.

Referring to anonymous sources, Reuters said the investigation spans multiple departments of the institution.
BaFin officials will examine the extent to which Allianz executives outside the fund division had knowledge of, or were involved in, events leading up to the funds racking up billions of dollars of losses.
In response to Citywire Selector's query, a spokesperson for the firm said Allianz regularly reports to and discusses with Bafin on all matters of relevance and importance for Allianz SE and Allianz Group.
'This also relates to the issues around the Structured Alpha Funds. That is part of the normal process and there are no new developments,' a spokesperson added.
Last year several US pension funds filed lawsuits connected to losses incurred by the Allianz's structured alpha funds.
The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System was one of the first to file a legal complaint seeking to recover losses from its allocation to AllianzGI's Structured Alpha US Equity 250, Structured Alpha Global Equity 350 and Structured Alpha Global Equity 500 funds.
The intervention of the German regulator follows the US Department of Justice's (DOJ) request for documents and information as part of an investigation into funds.
Commenting on the DOJ's involvement, Allianz confirmed its cooperation and also signalled the material impact on future financial results.
Allianz had to close two structured alpha funds in March 2020, which had $2.3bn in assets at the end of 2019, following losses from bad bets on options.

Writing an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal, the famed hedge fund investor said the US group's efforts to 'pour billions' into China was both a poor decision financially and one which could potentially endanger national security.
Soros said the company, which had outlined China as a major strategic area of growth, would most likely lose a large amount of client money trying to crack China.
He said BlackRock did not have a strong enough idea of where state-owned and privately-owned companies were divided, which meant it could potentially fall into difficult situations if it took Chinese interpretations of this division at face value.
Chinese government intervention to impose greater regulatory oversight has had negative implications for both the technology and education sectors in recent months.
Soros, who made a huge return betting on the US housing market collapse, also used the opinion piece to voice concerns about the Chinese real estate industry.
'There is an enormous crisis brewing,' he said. 'They may believe that investment funds flowing into China will help Mr Xi handle the situation, but the president's problems go much deeper.'
BlackRock has made several in-roads into the Chinese market in recent years, which includes developing a wealth management joint venture with Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and the China Construction Bank.

Decalia, which was formed by several former Syz Group employees, has undergone changes in recent months, with thematic manager Clement Maclou departing to oversee a food-based strategy at ODDO BHF.

2021-09-16,a1555180,Morningstar voices concerns as Hasenstab's fund drops to pre-global financial crisis size,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Chris Sloley,The Franklin Templeton heavyweight is aEUR~excitedaEUR(tm) by opportunities caused by volatility but research giant is wary of liquidity crunch.,"Michael Hasenstab's flagship fund is now the same size as it was prior to the global financial crisis, having dropped to $5.75bn in assets under management.
Using Morningstar data to the end of August 2021, the Ucits-compliant version of the Templeton Global Bond fund is now just above the $5.45bn level it sat at in March 2007. The fund steadily climbed in assets over the following five years before beginning to decline from the start of 2012 onwards.
Assets in the fund, which is run by Hasenstab, who is Templeton Macro Group CIO, and co-manager Calvin Ho, peaked at $43.6bn in February 2012, but dropped to $9.98bn in June 2020, according to Morningstar.
Citywire Selector recently dissected how Hasenstab intended to rebound from a particularly damaging start to last year, which was the second-worst individual quarter performance for the fund since he was named lead fund manager.
Speaking this week, Hasenstab used a market update to outline the fact he is now focusing his risk exposure on global currencies, as he seeks to capitalise on opportunities created by changing market dynamics.
The focus on risk management is timely, as Hasenstab's comments, dated 13 September, come shortly after Morningstar published its latest commentary on the Templeton Global Bond fund.
These comments, dated 10 September, were written under the banner 'concerns over risk management overwhelm this strategy's strengths'. Patrick Ge, a Morningstar analyst, highlighted how the high-conviction approach has the ability to recover quickly, but it is now experiencing sustained and persistent outflows.
'The strategy has been known to make up ground in a hurry, but its extreme volatility, paired with the spectre of persistent outflows, raise the portfolio's risk of liquidity trouble,' Ge wrote.
Franklin Templeton questioned the Morningstar analysis. A spokesperson told Citywire: 'The Templeton Global Macro strategies invest primarily in government bonds and currencies, which are broadly among the most liquid markets in the world and are designed to navigate volatility and liquidity risks during periods of extreme or stressed market conditions.'
The spokesperson added that many of the funds moved towards opportunistic repositioning at the end of 2020, which did not have any material or negative impact on its positions in smaller and less-liquid markets.
'The strategies are currently defensive on duration, with significant allocations to shorter maturity bonds in many of our target markets with appropriate levels of cash and cash equivalents.
'At the asset category level, we continue to emphasise local currency sovereign bond markets over credit markets, as local currency markets have historically shown ample liquidity. Local investor bases can often step in to buy local currency bonds, even as foreign investors may be fleeing them, providing a broad support base.'
A source familiar with the matter told Citywire that the Templeton Global Bond fund had no prior trouble meeting redemption or withdrawal requests, despite recent underperformance.
In addition, the source said, much of the underperformance in recent years, and notably through 2020, was driven by taking a position that could be deemed too risk-averse, which runs contrary to the Morningstar assessment.
So, what is Hasenstab focusing on now? He has identified currencies in Asia, such as the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee, as being particularly attractive at present, while also looking to make the most of valuations opportunities in Scandinavian currencies and the Canadian dollar against the euro, for example.
'No returns are without risk. We have chosen to target our risk budget towards the currency markets, both in developed markets as well as in select emerging markets. It gets us the yield advantage.
'We can do so, in many cases, without taking a lot of duration. There is currency volatility in there, but we think greater clarity in these paths of big factors gives us the confidence to go in that direction.'

Collins, who has been with the New Jersey-headquartered group since 1986, will come off the $6.1bn PGIM Global Total Return fund, the $71.3m PGIM Global Total Return (USD Hedged) fund, the $37.4m PGIM International Bond fund, and the $65.1m PGIM Global Dynamic Bond fund, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
He will be replaced on all four funds by Brett Bailey, who joins Robert Tipp and AA-rated Matthew Angelucci.
Collins will remain on the other six funds he runs, which are focused on US fixed income. These include the $59bn PGIM Total Return Bond fund, as well as PGIM Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond, PGIM Absolute Return Bond, PGIM Strategic Bond, PGIM Balanced, and PGIM Core Bond.
Collins co-manages the US funds with Tipp and Citywire + rated managers Richard Piccirillo and Gregory Peters. The foursome will be joined by Lindsay Rosner at the end of September, per the SEC filing.
He is also named on a handful of Ucits-compliant funds, namely the PGIM Absolute Return, PGIM Global Total Return Bond and PGIM Multi-Asset Credit funds.
'In response to the growth of our multi-sector investment strategies both in the US and globally, Mike Collins will focus entirely on the US multi-sector strategies with portfolio management responsibilities for more than $68bn in mutual fund assets, and more than $165bn in assets across mutual funds, separate accounts and comingled funds,' said a spokeswoman for the firm.

According to a shareholder letter, JPM AM intends to fully close the fund on 30 September. Investors were told about the decision on 16 September.
In the note, JPM AM said 'significant redemptions' meant it was no longer viable to run the strategy, which was first launched as a Luxembourg-domiciled product in 2013.

The fund was designed to invest in the US large-cap blend sector, using research-driven selection and risk characteristics that matched its company-assigned benchmark, the Russell 1000 TR.
JPM AM had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.

The duo will join the company in the new year from Finnish firm Aktia Asset Management, where they specialised in quality growth Nordic companies,
Brannback and Lahdesmaki will be based in Schroders' Helsinki office, opened in 2019, and will work closely with the asset manager's global and international small-cap team, as well as European equity managers.
Brannback manages the Aktia Nordic, Aktia Nordic Small Cap and Aktia Nordic Micro Cap funds.
He has over 20 years' investment experience and prior to joining Aktia in 2010 worked as a senior equity analyst at Handelsbanken Capital Markets and ABN Amro's Finland branch.
Meanwhile, his co-manager Lahndesmaki joined Aktia in 2014 and has over 16 years' investment experience, having been a portfolio manager at Nordea Asset Management Oy, where he oversaw the Nordea Suomi, Nordea Suomi Small Cap and Nordea Suomi 130/30.

A spokesperson for the asset manager confirmed the decision to introduce additional measures, following the initial report on NewsManagers.
As reported exclusively by Citywire Selector, the firm decided to soft-close the fund when it reached EUR7bn. The strategy had EUR9.3bn in assets under management at the end of August 2021.
In response to Citywire Selector's query, a spokesperson for the firm said existing investors' monthly net flows are now capped to $10m, which is equivalent to $500,000 per day. The fund is still closed to new investors.
'Demand for Pictet-Global Environmental Opportunities is extremely high. Therefore, we have limited the availability to existing investors.
'Capacity management is an important part of its investment process and is used to protect performance,' a spokesperson for the firm said.
When evaluating capacity, the asset manager considers three elements: process, resources and liquidity.
'We do not seek to grow assets at any cost and consider our primary goal to deliver returns to investors. Consequently, we may from time to time soft close or restrict flows into a strategy,' the spokesperson added.
According to the Morningstar data, the environmental opportunities fund has added over EUR600m in net inflows in January and February prior to its soft-closure. The fund has also experienced EUR287m in net outflows in May.
The Pictet Global Environmental Opportunities fund is not the first strategy in the ecology sector to introduce additional restrictions following the soft closure.
Nordea introduced a daily cap of EUR1m or the equivalent per shareholder for all institutional share classes for its climate fund in May of this year. This was after it added EUR2bn in additional assets following the soft closure in February.
Both Nordea and Pictet's funds are among the few strategies with longer than three years of track record in the sector, having launched their funds in 2008 and 2010 respectively.
The Pictet Global Environmental Opportunities fund is managed by Luciano Diana, Yi Du and Gabriel Micheli. It returned 72.8% in US dollar terms over the three years to the end of August 2021.

The VanEck Vectors New China ESG Ucits ETF, which the US group said is the first of its kind in Europe, is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Xetra Deutsche Borse.
VanEck said China's rapidly growing middle class, touching 400m people at present, means there is huge pent-up demand for new areas of growth. It added that GDP per capita has also risen, which indicates consumption patterns are shifting.
The new fund will target the strongest companies in this new economy, filtered according to ESG criteria, and aims to profit from the transformation of the Chinese economy. VanEck said increased spending on consumer and consumer staples is not just affecting manufacturers.
The strategy tracks the MarketGrader New China ESG index, which includes companies from just four sectors: non-consumer staples, consumer staples, healthcare and technology. The index selects the 100 companies with the most solid fundamentals and continuously evaluates them based on growth, valuation, profitability and cashflow.
VanEck said companies must exceed the regional median ESG score, which is regularly determined by OWL Analytics, using the OWL Analytics Consensus ESG Score. This score covers more than 25,000 companies worldwide and publishes monthly metrics aggregated from hundreds of independent ESG data sources.
'It's a new kind of consumer that is behind China's amazing growth,' said Martijn Rozemuller, CEO at VanEck Europe.
'They spend their money on innovative technologies, healthcare services, pharmaceuticals, consumer and luxury goods. China's economy continues to develop and companies in the country are adapting to the new consumer realities. Chinese companies that are part of the new economy are likely to outpace the country's overall growth.'
Rozemuller said e-commerce platforms play a very big role in China, as Chinese consumers are increasingly digitally savvy. 'At the same time, China's population is aging much faster than that of many other countries, according to the World Health Organization; by 2035, one in five Chinese could be 65 or older.
'As a result, overall spending on healthcare in China, for example on pharmaceuticals or telemedicine services, is growing - companies in the healthcare sector will benefit from this. Risks of investing in China: The assessment of Chinese financial reports by relevant regulators may not be adequate,' Rozemuller added.

It will invest in 50 high-conviction mid-cap growth equities with defensible competitive positions and high financial quality, investing in companies with strong balance sheets and cash flow generation that can compound long-term value.
The fund will be managed by Amy Y. Zhang, who also manages the Alger SICAV - Small Cap Focus fund. She currently runs a US-domiciled, mid-cap equity fund, which was launched in June 2019.

The vehicle, which is expected to have a first close early next year and a final close in December 2022, will be structured as a European Long Term Investment Fund (Eltif) in order to ensure access to a broader group of investors.
The fund, which has already attracted seed investment of EUR30m, will be run by Marc Romano, who was hired in July as head of impact private equity funds.
'We have a strong conviction to contribute to the change humanity is facing,' Romano told Citywire Selector. 'Innovation is a core part of the solution and we want to contribute to companies that innovate with a positive impact on the environment.'
The fund, which aims to invest between EUR5m to EUR20m in companies typically for a minority stake, will be targeting businesses that contribute to nine Sustainable Development Goals related to the environment, including water-related issues, climate change and the circular economy.
Romano said the strategy will allocate approximately 80% of its capital to companies in Europe in five key sectors including agritech and smart mobility.
The remainder of the capital will be dedicated to opportunities outside of Europe, mainly in North America and Israel, where there is a dynamic ecosystem of start-ups. Romano said he will be looking for businesses that are either already profitable or will be profitable in two to three years' time.
The fund has already made two investments with another two in the pipeline.
'We want the company to have a positive impact, but we also want companies that implement proper ESG standards,' he added. 'We expect the majority of our capital contribution to be used for capital increase with the purpose to accelerate the growth of the company and improve our impact contribution, and only some to be used to exit existing shareholders.'
Half of the team's share of the profits from the fund, or carry, will be subject to achieving impact targets.
To ensure an independent assessment of this, Mirova will have an committee, made up of some of the fund's limited partners and independent professionals. When an investment is exited, Romano said the impact will also be assessed by an independent third-party auditor.

Specific financial terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, were not disclosed.
O'Shaughnessy Asset Management (OSAM) is a pioneer in the field of 'custom indexing,' a term the firm coined itself.
Through the company's Canvas platform, OSAM offers factor-, tax-management- and ESG-inflected portfolios through separately managed accounts (SMAs) in which advisers can place client funds. Canvas has roughly $1.8bn in client assets.
'Technological advances are reshaping how financial solutions are delivered, and we continue to invest in innovative technology to enhance client outcomes and their experience,' said Franklin chief executive Jenny Johnson.
'Custom indexing is aligned with our commitment to bringing sophisticated customisation to a broader investment audience, and I'm excited to welcome the OSAM team to Franklin Templeton.'
Roughly 40 OSAM employees are expected to join Franklin Templeton as a result of the deal.
'As part of Franklin Templeton, we'll have the opportunity to accelerate client growth at Canvas and continue to add to existing OSAM offerings,' said OSAM chief executive Patrick O'Shaughnessy. 'We're excited by the incredible potential this acquisition creates and look forward to getting started.'
OSAM was founded by Patrick O'Shaughnessy's father, the legendary quantitative investor James O'Shaughnessy. In 2018, at the age of 32, Patrick took over CEO duties. He has also become known for hosting the popular 'Invest Like the Best' podcast.

The fund, which is Article 8 compliant, targets a return of more than 5% over cash and a volatility of 4-8% p.a. over three years. It will be comprised of 20-to-30 investment strategies spanning geographies and asset classes.
Abrdn said the fund will avoid the lowest-rated sovereigns, which means the fund would not invest in the sovereign bonds or currencies of China, Turkey, or India.
Katy Forbes, Gerry Fowler and Catie Wearmouth of the multi-asset solutions team will co-manage the fund.
An adrdn spokesperson said the team will implement abrdn's established Absolute Return approach whilst using a combination of ESG integration, screening, and enhancement criteria, to achieve the fund's sustainable and financial objectives.
'ESG integration incorporates an assessment of ESG factors into the investment analysis and decision making across all holdings of the fund. Exclusions mean that the team avoids investing in activities that present particular risks such as controversial weapons or companies engaged in coal extraction or power generation using coal,'
'The team aims to enhance the ESG characteristics of the companies and corporate bonds it invests in by avoiding the lowest rated companies in the riskiest sectors. They also avoid the lowest-rated sovereigns. Currently this means that the fund would not invest in the sovereign bonds or currencies of China, Turkey or India.'
To assess ESG risk, the team uses abrdn's proprietary ESG House Score developed by its central ESG investment team to assess companies in terms of their responsibility and environmental sustainability. The team ranks countries according to ESG and political factors and excludes those with the highest risk.
For its core global equity allocation, the Fund targets a 50% reduction in weighted average carbon intensity compared to passive global equities.

VanEck said the rare earth and strategic metals sectors stand to benefit from huge increases in technological applications, such as electric cars, wind turbines, satellite components, microchips or LCD televisions.

The fund had its first close and will continue to raise money monthly and in perpetuity, the firm said.
The strategy sits in Blackstone's Private Wealth Solutions division, which was set up to work in partnership with financial advisers to provide eligible individual investors access to Blackstone's funds.
The strategy has already invested in a UK logistics portfolio, which is fully leased on a long term basis.
'Blackstone's European Property Income strategy marks the next step in our continued commitment to delivering institutional quality solutions to eligible individual investors in Europe and Asia.
'This meaningful first close reflects the positive response and strong interest in private markets strategies that can complement investors' existing portfolios,' said Joan Solotar, global head of Private Wealth Solutions.
Real estate has not received as much attention as other parts of the private markets recently, with 2020 seeing the least amount of capital raised for the asset class since 2011, according to PitchBook.
So far this year, 85 real estate funds have only raised $49.9bn globally which is a little less than half of 2020's full-year total of $102.6bn raised across 250 funds.
'Real estate has been difficult to navigate, given the impact the pandemic has had on work and home space requirements and the shift in shopping habits that is benefiting warehousing and industrial but hurting retail,' said Hilary Wiek, lead analyst on fund strategies and performance at PitchBook.

The BNP Paribas Easy Low Carbon 100 Eurozone PAB Ucits ETF, which is listed on Euronext Paris and Deutsche Borse Xetra, meets European standards for Paris Aligned Benchmark indices.
This requires a strict exclusion of fossil fuels, an index carbon intensity reduction by at least 50% compared to its initial investment universe, and a portfolio decarbonisation target of at least 7% per year.
It also includes a carbon footprint measurement which acknowledges direct and indirect emissions, based on Scope 1, 2 and 3 of the Paris Agreement, and a SFDR Article 9-classified methodology.
The BNP Paribas Easy Low Carbon 100 Eurozone PAB Ucits ETF replicates the Euronext Low Carbon 100 Eurozone PAB NTR index, which focuses on 100 of the leading CO2 emission cutting eurozone companies.
At least 5% of the fund will consist of green companies actively participating in the energy transition, which are selected by a committee of experts.

The asset manager, which is the UK-based arm of the Gulf Investment Bank, has launched the GIB AM Sustainable World strategy in partnership with Amundi Ireland.
It sits within Amundi's Ucits funds partners ICAV, which is an Irish domiciled Ucits platform.

2021-10-12,a1567853,Blackstone takes stake in company behind Hipgnosis Songs Fund,Launch of new products,Threat,Citywire,Selin Bucak,Blackstone and Hipgnosis Song Management have announced a partnership that will see the creation of a $1bn fund.,"Blackstone is taking an ownership stake in the group behind the popular Hipgnosis Songs Fund (SONG) and will be making a $1bn initial commitment to a new unlisted fund.
The new strategy, launched as part of a partnership with SONG's investment adviser Hipgnosis Song Management (HSM), will acquire music rights and manage catalogues. The initial capital is seen as just the beginning of the newly announced partnership, which is expected to support the expansion of HSM's infrastructure and business functions.
SONG, which is the largest UK-listed investor in music catalogues, will have the opportunity to co-invest in future catalogue acquisitions alongside the new Blackstone-HSM partnership.
Merck Mercuriadis (pictured), the chief executive of HSM, said: 'Given the strength of our pipeline, we see the initial commitment as just the start of a long-term partnership between Blackstone and Hipgnosis that will also include co-investment with SONG.'
The partnership is backed by Blackstone's Tactical Opportunities strategy, which has $32bn in assets under management and makes investments that the firm's traditional investment strategies cannot.
Qasim Abbas, senior managing director of Tactical Opportunities, said: 'This partnership underscores the long-term, sustainable value we see in creative content across the wider entertainment industry, building on Merck's vision and dynamism.
'The music industry has been at the forefront of the fast-growing streaming economy and is unlocking new ways of consuming content.'
Hipgnosis's SONG raised PS200m in its initial public offering in July 2018 and has since amassed more than PS2.2bn in assets. The group's founder, Mercuriadis, used to manage artists including Elton John, Guns N' Roses and Beyonce. Among others, the fund has recently acquired the catalogues of Joel Little and Christine McVie, vocalist of Fleetwood Mac.
According to the Association of Investment Companies, it has returned 36.4% on a net asset value basis over three years.
The music royalties sector has been growing in recent years, becoming a more popular option for investors looking to diversify away from traditional equities and bonds. While Hipgnosis was the first listed closed-ended vehicle to offer access to investors in the UK, there have been others since then, including Round Hill Music.
Earlier this month, Apollo Global Management said it will back the launch of HarbourView Equity Partners, an asset manager in the media and entertainment space. And in March, KKR partnered with label and publisher BMG to acquire major music catalogues.
While private equity groups see music royalties as a lucrative opportunity because of the dependable recurring income, their involvement in the industry has been controversial.
The case of Taylor Swift brought attention to some of the issues in the industry: Buyout firm The Carlyle Group supported music mogul Scooter Braun's $300m acquisition of Big Machine Label Group and the rights to Taylor Swift's first six albums. Swift subsequently accused Braun of blocking the use of her music and was in an ongoing battle with him over the rights to her albums. She even pleaded with Carlyle Group to help her.
Last year, the rights to Swift's music were sold once again to a private equity firm, without her knowledge.",https://citywireselector.com/news/blackstone-takes-stake-in-company-behind-hipgnosis-songs-fund/a1567853?re=90114&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,2

The Luxembourg-domiciled funds will be overseen by Matthew Moberg, a portfolio manager in the Franklin Equity Group based in San Mateo.
He is also the lead manager on the Franklin Innovation fund, which was launched at the end of 2019.
Moberg said Franklin Templeton aims to uncover innovation across industries within new funds, while also touching on several distinct, long-term themes that will impact both the working world and private lives.
The first of the new funds, the Franklin Disruptive Commerce fund, will invest in companies benefitting from or facilitating advancements in emerging areas of ecommerce. This can include the sharing economy, which enables more convenient, customised, secure and time-efficient transactions.
According to supporting documents, industries such as media and travel have already gone through a significant ecommerce shift, while others, notably healthcare, telecoms and real estate, will advance more over time.
Meanwhile, the Franklin Genomic Advancements fund will invest in companies benefitting from or facilitating advancements of new genomic-based research techniques and technologies. This comes at a time when the cost and time involved in gene sequencing have decreased markedly.
It will invest in companies involved with extending and enhancing the quality of human and other life, driven by the advent of cost-effective and rapid gene sequencing. This has involved the growth from equipment and R&D spending to new areas, such as cloud storage of related data.
The third fund is focused on innovations that go beyond robotics and related fields. The Franklin Intelligent Machines fund will invest in companies benefitting from or facilitating advancements of machine-learning technologies in areas like robotics, driverless vehicles and algorithmic data analysis.
Intelligent machines are viewed as those helping drive innovation beyond robotics, such as intelligent maintenance, logistics, products, manufacturing and design. Moberg said this will ultimately impact all parts of the economy.

This withdrawal followed an outflow of PS2.3bn in the first half of the year, PS4bn in 2020, PS4.5bn in 2019, and PS4.6b. Since the start of 2020, outflows stand at PS6.9bn.
Client redemptions offset positive market movements of PS1bn, leaving assets under management marginally higher at PS60.7bn at the end of September, an increase of PS400m over the three months.
Jupiter said weak sentiment for its UK and European funds, alongside the Merlin range, were the main factors behind the latest outflow, the majority of which took place in July, according to the group.
It also noted that its Systematic strategies, predominately the North American equity fund, and the Global Equity Absolute Return contributed to the overall outflow.
On a more positive note, Jupiter pulled in PS300m across its fixed income strategies, while its global sustainability equities division attracted PS100m.
Several funds, which the group has identified as 'future growth drivers', also fared well. These included the Gold and Silver and Global Emerging Markets Short Duration Bond funds.
The market picked up on this positive note, with shares 1.9% higher at 244.2p at 8.15am, although they remain well below their 52-week peak of 310p hit in July.
The trading update comes after Citywire Wealth Manager revealed yesterday that the firm's chief investment officer, Stephen Pearson, would be leaving the business next year.

2021-10-20,a1571237,Axa IM targets European inflation with new bond fund,Launch of new products,Threat,Citywire,,The fund aims to outperform the euro area inflation as well as inflation strategy ESG ratings.,"Axa Investment Managers is launching an inflation-linked bond fund, which will be able to move between nominal and inflation-linked securities within Europe.
The fund, which is called the AXA WF Euro Inflation Plus fund, will use active break-even management with the aim of outperforming the euro area inflation, net of ongoing charges.
Jonathan Baltora (pictured), head of sovereign, inflation and FX, will run the actively managed fund together with Axa IM's wider inflation team.
In this approach, Baltora and his team will invest in sovereign nominal bonds and corporate bonds, as well as leveraged opportunities in OECD emerging markets. It is limited to investment grade fixed income assets, the exposure to which can be hedged against inflation through zero coupon inflation swaps.
A discretionary approach to inflation strategies, flexible allocation between nominal and linkers, and a broader asset allocation and income generation that exploits opportunities in other investment grade fixed income markets will guide the investment strategy.
Categorised as an Article 8 product as per SFDR, the fund follows Axa IM's exclusion policy and does not invest in countries sanctioned by international organisations, soft commodities, controversial weapons, or sectors linked to deforestation and climate risk.
It will be measured against Eurostat's Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices Excluding Tobacco, and aims to outperform the the ESG score of a parallel comparison portfolio constituted of 80% Bloomberg Barclays World Govt Inflation-Linked All Maturities 1-5yr and 20% ICE BofA 1-5 Year Global Corporate Index.
Baltora said: 'We believe there is a high probability that the euro area inflation will remain well above the level of nominal interest rates. As such, it becomes increasingly difficult for European investors to find assets that yield at least the inflation rate while remaining in the investment grade universe.
'Therefore, a product that aims to outperform the Euro area inflation can be a particularly attractive value proposition.
'Additionally, the fact that the fund can short inflation break-evens and target a higher ESG rating than the investment universe is a true innovation for inflation strategies currently being offered in the market.'
The Luxembourg-domiciled fund is registered for sale in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and in Italy as a restricted scheme.",https://citywireselector.com/news/axa-im-targets-european-inflation-with-new-bond-fund/a1571237?re=90353&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,1

The new fund, which is called the Lazard Coherence Credit Alternative fund, is a Ucits-compliant version of the team's Lazard Coherence Long/Short Credit strategy. It invests primarily in investment grade, crossover, and high-yield bonds in Europe and North America.
Both funds are managed by the former Coherence team of Sal Naro, Vincent Mistretta, Michael Cannon and Sanjay Aiyar. In this fund, the managers focus on consistent absolute returns and capital preservation, while seeking to limit interest rate volatility though hedging and other dynamic risk management.
The original version of the fund, which is available to US investors, was launched in 2012. It identifies positions based on the philosophy that fixed income markets are an extension of equity markets, seeking an 'early-mover' advantage by making investments ahead of yield spread and price changes driven by earnings and credit ratings momentum.
Lazard AM said the launch comes at a time when persistently low interest rates have led to a surge in corporate debt issuance. However, central bank tapering could unsettle much of these market dynamics, which means an active allocation is needed.
Sal Naro said: 'By viewing bonds as an extension of equity markets, rather than adopting a traditional fixed income approach, we seek to identify sector and credit spread migration early, leading to greater return potential, while looking to limit the tail risk for investors.'
The team uses a top-down approach to identify sector opportunities, then applies a multifactor model to identify potential long and short opportunities. Allocations in the portfolio are grouped by expected return drivers and are actively managed based on potential market opportunities and the macro landscape.
The fund is available to investors in the UK and Ireland, Germany, Austria, and France. It sits within Lazard AM's alternative investment platform, which had $3.9bn (EUR3.37bn) in assets at the end of Q3 2021.",https://citywireselector.com/news/lazard-am-launches-l-or-s-credit-fund-for-ex-boutique-team/a1576005?re=90828&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,1

An internal note from JP Morgan Asset Management indicated that Lee has stepped back from the fund, with Shilpee Raina moving into his role. Raina has been with the US-based investment house since 2005, primarily serving as an analyst covering US equity income.
JPM AM said the change took effect on 2 November and has no impact on the way the strategy is managed. The fund, originally launched in 1984, is a research-driven equity investment vehicle focused on analysing US stocks' future cashflows and earnings.
It is understood Lee remains with the firm, as he is named across a host of other equity funds, including the JPM US Select, JPM US Select Equity Plus and the JPM US Opportunistic Long-Short Equity fund.

The Castle Mount Impact Partners LP will invest in firms that are aligned with the UN sustainable development goals and fall under the following three themes: environmental sustainability, health & wellbeing and equality.
The strategy will allocate to a portfolio of 15-20 names, focusing on mid-market buyouts and growth equities predominantly in Western economies. The target size of the fund is over EUR200m.
It will target lower mid-market companies with an enterprise value of EUR500m or less. In addition to co-investments, it will selectively allocate to four to six specialist funds.
During the presentation in Glasgow, private equity lead at BMO Andrew Carnwath said the fund currently invests in wind turbine maintenance firm Rope Partners within its environmental bucket.
Some sub-themes the team will explore in the environmental sustainability space include climate change mitigation, pollution reduction, clean energy, sustainable agriculture/food, resource efficiency and circular economy.
An example of the firm that falls into the health and well-being segment is UK radiotherapy treatment Amethyst. Within the broader theme, the team will look at well-being and prevention, curative medicine, rehabilitation, palliative care and mental health.
An investment example of the third theme centred around equality is Cyberhawk, a company active in drone surveys and inspections for the energy industry.
Other sub-themes the team will tackle within the equality and inclusion space cover access to finance and technology, safe working environment, quality education, affordable housing and cyber security.

Enhorning has focused on equities since starting her career as equity analyst at Skandia in 1996. She also worked as equity fund manager at Folksam prior to joining Swedbank Robur in 2004.
Beltzer replaces Ulrika Linden, who has occupied the position since February 2019.

The New Capital Sustainable World High-Yield Bond fund, which sits within EFGAM's New Capital funds range, has been launched to complement its high-conviction global credit product range.
The fund is Article 8 compliant, and aims to tap the best returns using conviction-based investing in sustainable companies from around the world.
Lila Fekih and Mark Remington, part of New Capital's 10-strong fixed income team, will co-manage the fund. Currently, the team utilises two proprietary valuation models, which assess the price of a bond and probability of default.
Hard screens are applied followed by in-depth analysis assessing a company's vulnerability to ESG risks, financial implications of such risk, and crucially, a company's strategy to address such risks and capitalise on opportunities generated.
This analysis, which includes assessing the effectiveness of the management's sustainability strategy and the execution risks involved, is aimed at understanding the current risks but also how the future ESG trajectory impacts credit worthiness.
In addition to the wider fixed income team, Fekih and Remington will be supported by the in-house specialist ESG team.
The team defines a sustainable company as one which manages its ESG risks effectively to protect or enhance its financial profile. It may not have addressed all challenges, but the trajectory should be a positive one.
Fekih, co-manager on the fund, said: 'By investing in a portfolio of sustainable companies, we aim to reduce the number of potential defaults and maximize total return. We believe that companies that manage their ESG risks effectively will be able to reduce their financial risks.'
Moz Afzal, EFGAM's global CIO said: 'Increasing regulation and policies aimed at tackling climate change, decarbonisation and energy transition, coupled with technological innovation enabling companies to be more sustainable, is driving the flow of capital.
'Heightened social awareness and demand for responsible and sustainable business practices are further fuelling client demand. Ultimately this weight of capital means that sustainable investments will enjoy better access to funding and a lower cost of capital, impacting the financial health of a company.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/efgam-launches-first-its-sustainable-focused-hy-bond-fund/a1579174?re=91062&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,1
2021-11-10,a1580418,Life after Larry: Blue Chip veteran's successor reveals changes,Portfolio manager change,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Daniel Ruiz Hernandez,T. Rowe Price's Paul Greene is pushing incremental alterations to long-serving fund manageraEUR(tm)s $1.3bn fund.,"Paul Greene is not planning to reinvent the wheel when taking over from equity veteran Larry Puglia, but has unveiled a series of planned changes on the $1.3bn T. Rowe Price US Blue Chip Equity fund.
Greene, who assumed responsibility for both the US-domiciled and Ucits versions of the equity fund at the end of Q3 2021, said he would remain focused on long-term, patient investing, with a low turnover and an emphasis on high-quality stocks.
Having overseen the T. Rowe Price Communications and Technology Equity fund, Greene said there were nuances of Puglia's fund to understand, which involved working with the group's investment advisory committee.
However, since assuming control, he has undertaken a number of position changes so far.
'In time, the portfolio may hold slightly fewer names, as we look to emphasise our highest-conviction ideas in a particular area,' Greene said. 'The changes are more likely to occur in the portfolio's tail, as opposed to its larger positions.'
As of June, the portfolio remained heavily invested in the world's largest technology sectors, with a 9.4% position on Amazon, a 7.9% holding on Alphabet, 7.6% on Facebook (Meta Platforms), a 7.4% in Microsoft and a 4.5% on Apple.
By the end of September, with Greene has retained many of the same names. Amazon remains top at 9.5%, while the exposure to Microsoft was increased to 8.8%. Alphabet was trimmed down to 7.8%, while Facebook and Apple were the same.
'We acknowledge valuations for the broader US equity market appear demanding and certain segments offering exposure to popular growth themes look especially frothy,' Greene said.
'When it comes to valuation, we are willing to own some stocks that may look expensive in the near term, if we believe the rate at which the business is creating value could support further upside in the coming years.'
Greene said the higher-quality companies the fund tends to favour typically enjoy a degree of 'pricing power', which could help them weather an inflationary environment better than other business models.
'However, we do not want to own names where, in our estimation, the valuation could get in the way of stock performance over a multi-year period,' he added.
The portfolio saw an increase in the position of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, with a 1% holding, compared to 0.01% in June. The Walt Disney Company, with a 0.5% holding in September compared to 0.13% in June.
Car e-commerce retailer Carvana has now a 1.3% position in the fund, against 0.4% in June, while financial services firm Square has a 0.9% holding, compared to 0.09% in June. Meanwhile, the fund's holding on cloud-based software company Salesforce was lowered to 0.3% in September from 1.8% in June.
The strategy saw new additions in the form of financial technology group Affirm Holdings, with a 0.5% position as of September, as well as cloud-based software firm Bill.Com Holdings, with a 0.4% position, among others.
'We focus on the key fundamentals we believe drive long-term value creation at a specific company or in an industry,' Greene said. 'Near-term fluctuations in the broader market or a particular stock can be painful, but these gyrations may also create longer-term opportunities if we have conviction in a company's underlying business fundamentals.'
Greene said he noted how much innovation and competitive pressures are forcing many companies within the consumer and industrial sectors to become technology firms.
'Consider a leading apparel company developing its own applications and online presence to deepen its direct relationships with consumers - while deploying machine learning to improve its understanding of customers' tastes, manage inventory more efficiently, and personalise its product offerings.
'These capabilities and investments have the potential to be a massive competitive advantage over smaller competitors,' he said.
This also applied to the healthcare sector, as Greene said: 'In discussions with our healthcare team, I was struck by the powerful wave of innovation taking place, enabled by the convergence of faster and cheaper genomic sequencing, the increasing digitalisation of medical records and data, and the computing power and artificial intelligence to identify key correlations.'
The fund returned 67.4% in US dollar terms over the three years to the end of September 2021, while managing 23% in the past 12 months. The average fund in the Equity - US Growth sector returned 67.7% over three years.",https://citywireselector.com/news/life-after-larry-blue-chip-veteran-s-successor-reveals-changes/a1580418?re=91055&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,4

BlackRock wrote to shareholders on November 11 outlining plans to impose restrictions, which would see investments by existing and new unitholders capped at a maximum of EUR5m per day. These rules came into effect on 12 November.
The company said it had taken this course of action to allow Rothbarth to continue to invest in line with how the prospectus set out his investment thesis. It added that restricting further inflows was in the best interest of investors.
According to Morningstar data, the BGF Continental European Flexible fund had EUR4.7bn in assets under management as of the end of October 2020. BlackRock data from 11 November 2021 shows it now has EUR9.38bn in assets under management.
This trajectory coincides with Rothbarth becoming the sole lead on the fund, with it being announced he would take over from Alister Hibbert in October 2020. This move was designed to allow a change in focus for Hibbert, who made headlines recently when his earnings were found to be higher than BlackRock's CEO, Larry Fink.
The uptick in assets coincides with a stellar period of performance for Rothbarth, who sits seventh out of 111 managers in the Equity - Europe ex UK sector over the three years to the end of October 2021.

The firm has tapped Amy Oldenburg to replace him in the role. Oldenburg's appointment has taken effect immediately, though Sharma will stay on with the firm in some capacity at least through the end of the year.
Sharma, who also serves as chief global strategist for the firm's investment management arm, is set to step off the $745.6m (EUR651.3m) Morgan Stanley Institutional Emerging Markets portfolio effective from 31 December, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
He is listed on this fund alongside Paul Psaila, Eric Carlson, and Amay Hattangadi.
He manages funds with about $4bn in combined assets, according to Morningstar, though his purview was at around $20bn in 2016, according to an archived profile on Morgan Stanley's website.
Sharma's departure, which was first reported by Reuters and was confirmed to Citywire by a Morgan Stanley spokesperson, opens the door for Oldenburg to take on the emerging markets equity head role after more than two decades at the firm's asset management arm.
Reuters, citing an internal memo, also reported that Carlson, who holds a Citywire A rating, would take on a new role as head of sustainability.

Singapore-based Dilkes (pictured) is a 16-year veteran of the company and has been lead manager on the fund since it was launched nearly a decade ago.
The fund has lost around 17% so far this year, with the slide accelerating in the third quarter as fears mounted about contagion in the Chinese property market. Nearly half of the fund's assets are in China and 45.7% is invested in real estate debt.
Hong Kong-based Hayden Briscoe, head of global emerging markets and Asia Pacific fixed income, will take over as interim manager from 20 January until a successor is named. He will co-manage the fund with Singapore-based Michael Fleisch.
Dilkes's departure has prompted Morningstar to downgrade the fund from bronze to neutral.
Analyst Patrick Ge said: 'His steady presence here and track record of success underpinned our confidence in the investment team, and his impending departure meaningfully reduces our conviction here.'
Dilkes has also been a co-manager on the UBS China Allocation Opportunity fund, which blends equities and bonds, for just over three years. Briscoe will also take over his responsibilities on the fund, with Gian Plebani remaining as lead manager, and Bin Shi remaining as the equity portfolio manager.
This fund is also down around 17% this year. Although Morningstar's Ge described Dilkes' upcoming departure as a loss to the mandate, 'the continued presence of lead manager and asset allocator Gian Plebani, along with equity manager Bin Shi, provides reassurance and continuity'. The rating on fund was unchanged.
UBS was buying Evergrande's bonds until May this year and has one of the largest exposures among emerging markets funds to the debt-stricken developer, according to Morningstar.
The Swiss bank has recently grown more positive on Evergrande's bonds, estimating their recovery value at 30-40 cents in the dollar, up from the current value of 20 cents.
Evergrande faces a wall of debt totalling more than $300bn, with the next payment of $255m due on 28 December. The company has been limping to meet a string of deadlines in recent weeks, narrowly avoiding a default last month.
The Asian High Yield fund holds another embattled Chinese property developer, Kaisa Group, among its 10 largest positions.
Kaisa's shares have nosedived more than 70% this year, prompting a halt in trading earlier this month, as concerns grew about its debt pile. Kaisa has the highest offshore debt of any Chinese developer after Evergrande.
Beyond Evergrande and Kaisa, UBS's Asian credit team also holds a small position in Fantasia, which defaulted on a bond payment last week. Despite the surprise default, the team will maintain Fantasia's holdings as it expects recovery values to be between 20-30 cents on the dollar.
Overall, the firm remains optimistic that an outsize ripple effect on China's property and banking sector due to Evergrande's fall is unlikely.",https://citywireselector.com/news/ubs-3-3bn-asian-high-yield-manager-exits-amid-fund-losses/a1582485?re=91292&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,3

The fund, which Dilkes had run since launch nearly a decade ago, has lost around 17% since the turn of the year, prompting Morningstar to downgrade it from bronze to neutral earlier this week.
'Given the material impact of Dilkes' impending departure, uncertainties surrounding his replacement, and the broader team's turnover, we have downgraded the strategy,' said Patrick Ge, analyst at Morningstar.
The Asan High Yield fund will be taken over by Hayden Briscoe, head of global emerging markets and the Asia Pacific fixed income team, on an interim basis from 20 January until a successor is named.
Yew reports into Singapore-based Dilkes and Lou reports to Hong Kong-based Briscoe, who will also take over Dilkes' responsibilities on the fixed income portion of the UBS China Allocation Opportunity fund, which has also lost around 17% this year.

The partnership to develop a nutrition-based strategy was announced over the summer and now takes the shape of the Credit Suisse JPMorgan Sustainable Nutrition fund, which will have global portfolio of between 40 and 60 small- and medium-cap stocks.
The Ucits-compliant strategy, which has $250m (EUR221m) in seed capital, was released this week, targeting the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 13 (Climate Action), with a particular focus on companies making food systems less carbon intensive.
The investment process will focus on three sub-themes, namely sustainable agriculture, efficient food processes, and sustainable and healthy diets. Vertical farming, plant-based proteins and food testing are some of the activities the fund will be investing in.
Credit Suisse will manage the fund, choosing the nutrition theme, trades, risk management and sales activities, while JP Morgan will act as the sub-adviser. It will carry out the selection and support sales activities, a spokesperson for Credit Suisse said.
The strategy will sit within Credit Suisse's investment solutions and products team, which is part of the group's sustainability, research, and investment solutions division.
'As we transition towards a more sustainable global economy, a focus on sustainable nutrition should sit at the heart of this transition,' Jennifer Wu, global head of sustainable investing at JPM Asset Management said.
'This new strategy seeks to make a positive contribution to a healthier future, investing in companies which are seeking to address current inefficiencies in the food value chain by making food systems less carbon intensive and ultimately enabling healthier diets,' Wu added.

2021-11-23,a1586491,BlueBay launches ESG-focused multi-asset credit fund,Launch of new products,Threat,Citywire,,"The Article 8 fund offers a higher yield than most of its competitors by increasing its credit risk, Citywire Selector can reveal.","BlueBay has expanded its ESG suite with a total return-focused, diversified credit strategy, the fourth ESG-focused fund launched by the firm this year, Citywire Selector can exclusively reveal.
Domiciled in Luxembourg, the the BlueBay Total Return Diversified Credit ESG fund currently has $40m (EUR35.5m) in assets under management but is expected to increase upon launching.
It will be managed by Raphael Robelin, head of multi-asset credit at BlueBay, with Blair Reid as senior portfolio manager and Maria Satizabal as portfolio manager.
The fund is categorised under Article 8 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and will use BlueBay's ESG research to provide ESG-filtered opportunities across global high yield, bank loans, financial capital bonds, structured credit, convertible bonds, emerging markets and developed market investment grade.
Speaking to Citywire Selector, Reid said the fund functions as a sister to BlueBay's standard multi-asset credit strategy and reflects the current demand for ESG in multi-asset credit.
The new fund overlaps with 75% of the flagship fund, but its credit risk has been slightly increased to a BB average in order to produce a similar yield to the standard multi-asset credit strategy, which sits at an average credit risk of BB+.
This approach differs from the majority of multi-asset credit (MAC) ESG strategies on the market, which run on a similar level of credit risk and therefore offer slightly lower yield than their non-ESG equivalents.
Reid, however, said lower yield disincentivises investors from MAC ESG, and the reduction in ESG risks outweighs the increase in credit risk.
'If you do more ESG, you will inevitably end up with a safer portfolio, and safer portfolios have lower yield. What was clear to us was that there was certainly demand for more ESG, but investors were less keen on a reduction in yield. So, minimising the loss of yield meant taking a little bit more credit risk,' Reid told Citywire Selector.
Unlike its flagship sister, the MAC ESG strategy excludes issuers in the very high ESG risk category and has a minimal exposure to issuers with a high ESG risk, which will only be included if they are on a trajectory heading to medium.
Sovereigns that have not ratified the Paris Agreement are excluded from the fund, as well as controversial weapons and tobacco companies. Likewise, companies deriving revenues from oil sands and arctic drilling will be avoided.
Exposure to emerging market corporates and sovereigns, which generally have lower ESG scores, has been reduced to 25% compared with 45% in the flagship strategy, although the fund is able to increase exposure for engagement purposes.
The strategy does, however, have a limited exposure to companies earning revenues from thermal coal or fossil fuel exploration and production, in cases where coal as a legacy asset makes up less than 5% of the business.",https://citywireselector.com/news/exclusive-bluebay-launches-esg-focused-multi-asset-credit-fund/a1586491?re=91520&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,0

In his stead, Greg Temo has become lead portfolio manager on the Muzinich Long Short Credit Yield fund alongside Eddie Yu and Hillel Olshin. The spokesperson said there was no change to the investment process and Liebermann helped with the transition process.

2021-11-24,a1587007,"Best-selling climate funds not curtailing carbon exposure, study claims",Negative press,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Siri Christiansen,Research into EuropeaEUR(tm)s most popular strategies indicates that only a small number are delivering when it comes to carbon reduction.,"Less than half of the top-selling European climate funds have a consistently lower carbon exposure than the MSCI World index.
That is according to recent analysis of the seven most popular strategies among European fund buyers, carried out by portfolio analytics, reporting and data provider Investment Metrics and shared with Citywire Selector.
Only two of the six active funds - the CPR Invest Climate Action and BNP Paribas Climate Impact funds - have a lower exposure to carbon than the MSCI World index, which is neither ESG-specific nor low-carbon.
The passive Amundi Index MSCI Global Climate Change ETF offers the least carbon exposure out of the group, with approximately half that of the MSCI World index.
Meanwhile, the actively managed LO Funds Climate Transition fund has more than double the exposure.
The findings reflect that climate funds tend to favour investments in firms that are part of the long-term transition to a lower carbon economy, said Investment Metrics.
But the stark difference is only one of a wide range of variables in environmental approaches, sector exposure, fundamental factors and performance between climate funds.
The disparities in investment practices in climate funds has widened significantly since last year, according to Damian Handzy, Investment Metrics' head of research.
'That range is only going to get bigger. As more money flows in, funds need to differentiate themselves and therefore the range of investment approaches widens,' Handzy told Citywire Selector.
'The bottom line is that an investor must look under the hood of funds to understand what they're getting and what they're exposed to.'
The evaluation included the following funds: BNP Paribas Climate Impact; DWS Invest ESG Climate Tech; CPR Invest Climate Action; Franklin Templeton Global Climate Change; LO Funds Climate Transition; Candriam Sustainable Equity Climate Action; and the passive Amundi Index MSCI Global Climate Change ETF fund.",https://citywireselector.com/news/best-selling-climate-funds-not-curtailing-carbon-exposure-study-claims/a1587007?re=91518&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,3
2021-11-26,a1588564,Berenberg launches Europe ex-UK fund for AAA-rated CIO,Launch of new products,Threat,Citywire,,German group expands its footprint of European equity offering with new strategy.,"Berenberg Wealth and Asset Management has further expanded its European equity fund range with a third strategy for its chief investment officer, Matthias Born.
The Berenberg Europe ex-UK fund, which is Luxembourg-domiciled, will employ the group's long-term quality growth strategy, which underpins all its existing European equity funds, namely the European Focus and Eurozone Focus funds.
Born will focus on companies with high-growth potential, unique selling points and sustainable business models while also incorporating a robust ESG screening process for stock selection.
It will operate as a concentrated portfolio of 40 all-cap stocks and single out market-leading European companies. Berenberg gave the examples of Dutch company ASML, German semiconductor specialist Infineon and food-delivery-kit start-up HelloFresh as the types of stocks it would follow.
Born, who is also head of equities at Berenberg Wealth and Asset Management, said the strategy would capitalise on the fact there are several European companies whose unique products and capabilities are not replicated by companies from any other region and cannot be found elsewhere, including in the US.
Born also aims to uncover under-researched areas of the market, namely within small caps, which will see him use fellow former Allianz Global Investors' fund manager Peter Kraus and his team's knowledge.
Born said: 'European equities are a dynamic space to be in if you know where to look. Some might say Europe is an old continent and the market leaders and high-growth companies of tomorrow are to be found in Silicon Valley or China.
'In stock picking, our aim is always to find companies with a distinct proposition that will sustain growth over the long-term, regardless of market shocks. In addition, we are well aware of the strong returns to be had from judicious stock picking in the small-cap space and the Europe ex-UK fund will enjoy the support of our dedicated small-cap team.
'Over the long term, research suggests small caps do outperform large caps but the large caps we have chosen in the existing funds have nevertheless outpaced the small-cap benchmarks, so we aim for a blend of company sizes.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/berenberg-launches-europe-ex-uk-fund-for-aaa-rated-cio/a1588564?re=91513&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,4

Nicolas Cremieux, co-head of convertibles, will oversee the new strategy, believed to be one of the first of its kind.
It aims to provide investors with convexity on a permanent basis, while also displaying a high active share.
Cremieux said: 'The convertible bonds asset class is currently in the sweet spot, as companies look to capitalise on the historically low-rate environment to support growth plans.
'We saw record levels of convertible bond issuance in 2020, and 2021 is on course to match this level. As the compelling potential of convertible bonds increasingly appeals to clients, our new strategy is perfectly placed to capture many of the exciting opportunities on offer in the space.'
The strategy also reflects the manager's unconstrained approach across sectors and regions, alongside a significant position in off-benchmark opportunities.
It consists of about 50 positions, with Cremieux and his team pursuing convertible issuers below $5bn (Ie4.4bn) in size within a few high growth sectors which enjoy lower default rates and display strong liquidity profiles, like healthcare and technology.
Like Mirabaud's other convertible bond offerings, the newly launched strategy has a fully ESG integrated process and is classified as Article 8 under Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.
Mirabaud's convertible bonds team, which oversees $1bn assets, consists of five Paris-based sector specialists, with more than six decades of combined experience in the sector.",https://citywireselector.com/news/mirabaud-am-launches-small-and-mid-cap-global-converts-strategy/a1590017?re=91750&ea=1781405&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,1
2021-12-01,a1590418,Vanguard taps Baillie Gifford and Wellington for new China fund,Launch of new products,Threat,Citywire,,The fund is expected to launch in early 2022 with an expense ratio of 0.73% for its cheapest share class.,"Vanguard is planning to launch a new active Chinese equity fund in early 2022, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Vanguard China Select Stock fund will be subadvised by Wellington Management and Baillie Gifford, both of which are regular subadvisers for the $8.4tn (EUR7.4tn) Pennsylvania-based asset manager.
Baillie Gifford's sleeve of the fund will be run by Sophie Earnshaw and Mike Gush. Bo Meunier will oversee Wellington's portion of the fund.
The fund will invest in onshore and offshore China equities and will have an expense ratio of 0.73% for its Admiral shares class. That rises to 0.83% for the fund's Investor shares.
'Vanguard research indicates that there is an opportunity for talented active managers to generate alpha in China's large, but inefficient, equity market,' said Kaitlyn Caughlin, head of Vanguard's portfolio review department.
Vanguard's decision to launch a China fund is 'a big deal' because the asset manager has previously focused on regional funds rather than single-country strategies, said Dan Wiener, chairman of Adviser Investments and editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors newsletter.
Wiener said the language Vanguard used in announcing the fund's launch was also noteworthy.
'What's most interesting is the focus on risk and alpha and performance in their press release,' he said.
The Vanguard release says that 'both [Wellington Management and Baillie Gifford] have deep portfolio management experience and expertise in China and a track record of outperformance in Chinese equity markets.'
Wiener said: 'They don't usually talk about a manager's ""track record of outperformance"" nor focus so much on generating alpha. The fact that they are going active rather than passive also speaks to going ""all in"", in my view.'
Vanguard does not have any other such single-country emerging markets funds, but it does offer strategies with wider exposure to China. These include two index offerings: the $78.3bn Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index fund and the $5.6bn Vanguard Pacific Stock Index fund, and the actively managed $974.4bn Vanguard Emerging Markets Select Stock fund. The latter fund is also subadvised by Wellington and Baillie Gifford, as well as Oaktree Capital Management and Pzena Investment Management.
Of the managers running the new China fund, only Gush is also named on the wider Emerging Markets fund too.
He and Earnshaw also run the Baillie Gifford China Equities fund, launched in July, alongside Roderick Snell.
Vanguard's decision to launch a standalone China fund comes during a difficult year for the country's market, which was rocked by a government clampdown on the technology sector and high-profile problems at its second-largest real estate developer, Evergrande, which has struggled to make interest payments on loans and flirted with insolvency.

Established in 2009, Greencoat is one of Europe's largest renewable infrastructure firms with EUR7.8bn (PS6.7bn) in assets under management.
The firm covers a wide area of infrastructure investing, including wind, solar, bioenergy and heat. It operates nearly 200 power generation assets across the UK, Europe and the US, with an aggregate net generation capacity of over three gigawatts.
Greencoat's investor mandates typically comprise permanent or 25-year capital. It oversees a number of renewable investment companies, including the Greencoat UK Wind and Greencoat Renewables trusts.
According to a regulatory announcement confirming the deal, the firm received EUR1.8bn (PS1.6bn) worth of net inflows in the 12 months to 30 November.
The purchases is part of Schroders' strategy to build a significant private assets platform and bolster its sustainability position and it sees the provision of private capital for energy transition as essential to achieve net zero targets.
With the US and European renewable energy assets forecast to grow by around $1tn to 2030, the fund manager is positioning itself to take advantage of this through the Greencoat acquisition.
'Greencoat is a market-leading, high growth business, with an outstanding management team, which provides access to a large and fast-growing market in high demand among our clients,' Schroders CEO Peter Harrison (pictured) told the market.
'Its culture is an excellent fit with ours and Greencoat's focus aligns very closely to our strategy, continuing our approach of adding capabilities in the most attractive growth segments we can provide to our clients.'
He added: 'We have demonstrated our ability to integrate acquisitions successfully, to generate growth and create significant value for our shareholders. We are confident that we will be able to leverage the strengths of both firms while preserving Greencoat's differentiated position in the market.'
The firm's four founders, Laurence Fumagalli, Bertrand Gautier, Stephen Lilley and Richard Nourse, will remain with the business following the purchase.
'We are all delighted to have found a partner in Schroders who sees the potential of our business and believes deeply in our mission to build a global leader in renewables investing,' Nourse said.
'We are extremely proud of what the brilliant team at Greencoat has together achieved, creating a market-leading renewables asset management firm in the UK and Ireland, a strong platform in Europe and an important expansion into the US.

'The thematic pocket on the other hand, seeks to invest in companies whose business models are at their core best aligned with the United Nations sustainable development goals. Given the vast possible impact areas, this pocket tends to focus on niche companies in a sector, or companies that can be considered as pure ESG players,' she added.

The Dutch asset manager told Citywire Selector that Falkman will start working in its thematics team as of next week. Her departure was also confirmed by Swedbank.
'Natalie Falkman has decided to take on new challenges outside Swedbank and Swedbank Robur,' said a spokesperson for the firm. 'We thank her warmly for her contribution to Robur and wish her the best of luck with her future endeavours.'
Falkman first made the announcement on LinkedIn, which was first reported by AMWatch. She highlighted how she was stepping down from the firm's Kapitalinvest fund, which she said was one of the best-in-class in its category.
'I am glad that I am able to leave the fund that I have managed for the past five years in good shape,' she wrote on her profile.
The Kapitalinvest strategy, which has SEK60bn (EUR5.8bn) in assets and is registered for sale in Sweden only, will now be overseen by Patric Naeslund, according to the fund's factsheet.
As of January, the fund ranks 30th in Equity - Global Bend sector, with a 100.6% return in US dollar terms over the past three years to the end of November 2021.

Tony Scherrer has left and stepped off the $3.4bn Smead Value fund, leaving William Smead and Cole Smead to co-manage the strategy. Scherrer was also named on the Ucits-compliant version of the strategy.
'When the firm relocated to Arizona in July 2020, Tony made the deeply personal decision, along with his family, not to make the move,' said the firm in a statement on Scherrer's departure.
'We consider Tony to be part of the Smead Capital hall of fame,' the statement said. 'We wish him all the best, wherever God takes him in the next stage of life.'
Smead Value has returned just under 16.5% on an annualised basis for the decade through 2021, coming first in Morningstar's Large Value category for that period. All three managers hold AA ratings with Citywire.
That performance outstripped the 13% return of the Russell 1000 Value index, and nearly matched the 16.5% return of the Russell 1000 index.
The fund's contrarian streak is on full display now, with 19% of its assets in the energy space, the most of any fund in the Large Value category.

Safaryan was most recently at Credit Suisse Asset Management (Switzerland) and brings more than 10 years' experience managing EMD strategies.
He was most recently in charge of the $2bn Credit Suisse (Lux) Emerging Market Corporate Bond fund, as well as other EM corporate bond funds totalling about $1bn in assets.
Together with Cornel Bruhin and Roman Kostal, he will manage the MainFirst - Emerging Markets Corporate Bond and MainFirst - Emerging Markets Credit Opportunities funds.
The hire follows the recent departure of Thomas Rutz, EMD fund manager and CEO of MainFirst Switzerland, as well as portfolio managers Dorothea Frohlich, Tanja Kusterer and Dimitros Nteventzis.
The trio departed in August last year and have since resurfaced at Zurich-based investment house, Fisch Asset Management.
Both funds lost more than half of their assets following the departure of Rutz and his team. The MainFirst - Emerging Markets Corporate Bond sat at EUR163m in December, compared with EUR376m in August.
The MainFirst - Emerging Markets Credit Opportunities fund dropped to EUR125m in December from EUR256m in August.
The bigger of the two strategies, the MainFirst - Emerging Markets Corporate Bond fund returned 18.4% in US dollar terms over the three years to the end of November, versus a Citywire's Bonds - Emerging Markets Global Corporates sector average of 17%.

2022-01-12,a2376430,Quilter shuts struggling funds flagged in 2021 value report,Liquidation of a fund,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Nicola Blackburn,"The Strategic Bond fund and Global Property Securities fund will close this month, with all investments returned to shareholders unless an investment transfer is requested.","Quilter Investors has closed its Strategic Bond and Global Property Securities funds after years of underperforming their benchmarks.
The funds, which held PS40m and PS41m, respectively, before the announcement in December of their closures, will be shut on 26 January. All investments will be returned to shareholders, and investors have been given the deadline of 19 January to request a revised fund investment choice.
The closures come after the funds, along with two other funds that remain open, were highlighted as 'requiring action' in Quilter Investors' annual value assessment report last year.
The report said that while the funds had delivered their primary objectives, long-term performance was 'below the anticipated level of value' and was behind that of their performance comparators.
In a statement about the closures, a spokesperson for Quilter said: 'Quilter Investors has undertaken a review of the Global Property Securities fund and the Strategic Bond fund. Having assessed all options available, we believe that shareholders' interests will be best served by closing the funds and returning the proceeds to shareholders.
'We have communicated accordingly with shareholders in the fund to inform them of their options following the decision to close.'
The Strategic Bond fund, managed by Sacha Chorley, Anthony Gillham and Hinesh Patel, has more than halved in size in the past five years, hitting lows of PS33.9m in November, according to Morningstar.
An assessment value report of the fund, published in March last year, said it had underperformed its performance comparator, the Investment Association's Sterling Strategic Bond sector, despite achieving its own 'total return objectives' (see performance data below).
The fund, which allocates at least 70% of its holdings to collective investment schemes, lost its manager of nine years in 2019. Quilter's report said that replacing the manager meant it would 'take time to achieve positive results from the change'. It also cited the fund's exposure to fixed income as the reason for its poor performance since the start of the pandemic.
In the three years to the end of November, the fund is ranked 56th of 61 in its Citywire sector.
Quilter Investors' Global Property Securities fund, which allocates more than 70% to real estate investment trusts (Reits) and real estate companies, was also flagged as requiring action in March due to 'comparable market rates'.
Managed by JPL Asset Management, it aimed to outperform the FTSE Epra/Nareit Developed index over rolling five-year periods, net of charges (see performance data below).
The fund never took off with investors to gain any significant size. It shrank from PS48.9m to PS40.8 in the five years to November 2021, according to Morningstar. Several months of inflows in Q3 of 2018 were succeeded by continuous monthly outflows in 2019.
Quilter said the fund's particularly poor performance in 2019 was due to its underweight position in industrial Reits and an overweight position in German residential holdings. The portfolio had since been adjusted, it added.
Investors pulled PS9m from the fund in December following its announced closure.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/quilter-shuts-struggling-funds-flagged-in-2021-value-report/a2376430,6

Ziverte joined William Blair as head of fixed income in 2019 but has been removed as a co-manager on three funds set to be liquidated, per a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. She previously worked as a senior portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds.
It is understood that Ziverte recently informed the firm of her resignation, prompting William Blair to wind down the funds she had been co-managing. The firm declined to comment beyond the SEC filings.
Also, according to the filing, the company plans to liquidate three of its four fixed income funds in April, after its head of fixed income left the firm.
Termination of the $285m William Blair Bond, $101m William Blair Short Duration Bond and $37m William Blair Ultra-Short Duration Bond funds is set for April 15, according to a filing with the SEC. All three are closed to new investors but will remain open to existing investors for two weeks.
The changes did not appear to affect the $50m William Blair Emerging Markets Debt fund, which launched in 2021 after the firm brought in Marcelo Assalin and Marco Ruijer and their team from NN Investment Partners to manage it.
Two of the three funds have shown relatively strong performance, according to Morningstar data on their annualized three-year returns.
The William Blair Bond fund, which has been co-managed by Vesta Marks since July, has beaten most competing funds by delivering a 3.8% return compared with 3% for the Morningstar Core Bond index.
The William Blair Short Duration Bond fund, also co-managed by Marks, has returned 2.14% annualized over three years compared with 1.87% from the Morningstar US 1-5 year Core Bond, but it is in near lockstep with the category average of 2.15%.
The William Blair Ultra-Short Duration Bond fund, which Ziverte had co-managed alongside Marks and Kathleen Lynch, has returned 1.65% in that same span, lower than the Morningstar US 1-5 year Core Bond index's 1.87% but better than most funds in its category.
Ziverte holds positions between $100,000 and $500,000 in both the Bond and Short Duration Bond funds, per Morningstar. Lynch's holdings in the Ultra-Short Duration Bond fund were between $500,000 and $1m at last tally.

According to a letter sent to shareholders and seen by Citywire, the fund, which is managed by Alistair Way and Jonathan Taub, will formally close on 4 April.
Investors' holdings will either be redistributed to other areas or returned in cash if they are held as a standalone investment in the fund.
'Going forward, [Aviva] is looking to adopt a sustainable outcomes approach and will prioritise those equity funds with a sustainable focus, something which the fund is not aligned to,' the letter said.
The move comes against the backdrop of increasing investor focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and sustained inflows into sustainable funds.
Aviva added that the fund has underperformed over the past 12 months and some investments are being withdrawn, resulting in a considerable reduction in the fund's size.
A spokesperson for Aviva said: 'In June 2021 we decided to refocus our equities business on sustainable outcomes and core strategies where there is clear client demand, namely UK and global equities, while retaining sufficient coverage to support our multi-asset strategies.'
The Global Equity Unconstrained fund launched in August 2019. A year later, its assets under management had grown to PS123m, according to Morningstar data. Assets peaked at PS136m in December that year.
An assessment of value report for the fund last year revealed it had been underperforming its benchmark, which Aviva said was due to overexposure to underperforming Brazilian and Chinese stocks. The fund returned 15.71% in the 12 months to October 2021, while the MSCI All Countries World Index returned 19.84%.
The fund is classified by Morningstar as having a medium level of sustainability risk.
Its closure comes after its former managers - Mikhail Zverev and Jaime Ramos-Martin - left Aviva in 2021 when the business announced a shake-up of its equities team in a bid to cut costs.

2022-02-28,a2381029,UBS and boutiques follow JPM AM in suspending Russia and EM Europe funds,Closure,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley and Siri Christiansen,"Franklin Templeton, Pictet and many others announce measures to limit or temporarily cease trading.","UBS, East Capital, Carnegie Fonder, Danske Invest and Liontrust have become the latest groups to shutter or temporarily freeze Russia, Eastern Europe or emerging Europe funds in light of the Ukrainian conflict.
Citywire Selector reported that JPM Asset Management was among the first to cease trading, with measures imposed on its Russia and Emerging Europe Equities funds in the morning of 28 February.
Several more groups cited the closure of the Moscow Exchange to foreign investors as the primary driver for suspending dealing.
Speaking to Citywire Selector on the morning of 1 March, a spokesperson for UBS Asset Management confirmed that the UBS (Lux) ES Russia fund was now closed for trading.
A spokesperson said: 'In light of current events, it is not possible to calculate the fund's net asset value. Accordingly, to protect the interests of all investors, the fund board has taken the decision to temporarily suspend subscriptions and redemptions.'
Amundi has also discreetly suspended subscriptions and redemptions into three equities funds with exposure to Eastern Europe, an Amundi spokesperson told Citywire Selector.
The firm's Russian exposure is limited at 0.1% of global assets. Amundi said that it has hedged a significant part of its portfolios as the uncertainty over the conflict remains elevated.
Swedish group Carnegie Fonder is among the most vocal, with a lengthy explainer for the suspension of trading in the Carnegie Rysslandsfond which is approaching its 25th anniversary. The fund's lead manager, Fredrik Colliander, was once quoted as saying his stock ideas 'will outlive Putin'.
Danske Invest decided to shutter any funds with a 'significant weight' of Russian equities. This has implications for its Luxembourg-domiciled Russia and Eastern Europe funds, as well as its Denmark-domiciled Osteuropa fund.
East Capital has also suspended trading in its Russian and Eastern European funds, which are overseen by the company's chief investment officer and regional veteran, Peter Elam Hakansson. The Russian fund was initially launched in 1998 and has amassed EUR485m in assets.
Swedbank Robur closed trading in its Russia and Eastern Europe fund yesterday (28 February), citing Swedish consumer protection laws as its primary reason as it is difficult to make a reliable valuation of Russian equities.
A Nordea spokesperson confirmed to Citywire Selector that buy transactions have been closed for the Nordea Russia fund and the Nordea Eastern Europe fund, as well as any fund with more than 50% exposure to the Russian market.
Similarly, the Swedish Pensions Agency has suspended trading in four Russian funds - Swedbank Robur Rysslandsfond A, Nordea Rysslandsfond, Carnegie Rysslandsfond A and East Capital Ryssfond - on its pension trading platform, due to concern over customers.
'We're withdrawing the possibility to buy the funds that has the most pronounced focus on Russian investments. This is being done to protect the pension savers,' said Erik Franksson, director of the fund department at the Swedish Pensions Agency.
UK group Liontrust has suspended dealing in the Liontrust Russia fund, which is run by Thomas Smith and was originally overseen by industry stalwart Robin Geffen. Geffen ceded control of the fund when Liontrust purchased his group Neptune in 2019.
'We have not taken this action lightly but in this case we believe this is in the best interests of all investors given the events of the past few days and comes after discussions with the fund's depositary. These events include today's closure of the Moscow Stock Exchange and the temporary ban on foreign investors selling local Russian securities.
'At the moment, Liontrust is unable to say how long the fund will be suspended for. Liontrust will keep the suspension of the Russia fund under continual review given it is such a rapidly changing situation and we will update investors as soon as we can,' a spokesperson said.
Beyond boutique names, larger operators have also moved to close their strategies for the time being. The Pictet - Russian Equities fund was closed on 28 February due to challenges around calculating the NAV.
A statement from the group read: 'In light of the current and ever-evolving circumstances associated with Ukraine/Russia situation, the current political situation and liquidity constraints make it impossible for the brokers to trade securities on the Russian stock exchange, and even if trading becomes possible again in the future the possibility for the compartment to convert Russian rouble into US dollars would be seriously jeopardised such that trades could not be settled in a normal manner'
Franklin Templeton also confirmed to the Citywire Selector's sister site Citywire Asia that it was suspending its Eastern Europe fund. The fund, which has EUR210m in assets, is overseen by Krzysztof Musialik.
A spokesperson for the group said the Franklin Templeton as a whole has limited exposure to Russian assets at a firm level.
'We are closely monitoring developments that may impact financial markets including sanctions, actions by governments and developments in Ukraine itself. We continue to assess any potential actions needed, as facts and circumstances are subject to change and may be specific to investment strategies and jurisdictions.'
Ratings group Fitch Ratings said the ramifications for European mutual funds could be huge, as sanctions on Russian entities increase. It singled out 10 funds running a collective EUR4.2bn in Russia- and emerging market-related assets as having closed so far.
It said there are EUR640bn worth of emerging market strategies in operation, which could have some level of Russian exposure, while there were EUR5.2bn worth of direct Russian equity strategies in operation, as at the end of January 2022.
In a note published on 28 February, the group said: 'We believe further Russia-focused funds may suspend redemptions, driven initially by an inability to trade portfolio securities. Funds may temporarily suspend redemption (known as gating) if available liquidity is insufficient to meet redemption requests, or if market closures or related issues mean funds cannot trade their portfolios effectively.
'The closure of the Russian stock exchange, for example, could force funds with domestic exposure to suspend redemptions due to an inability to trade effectively. Similarly, if there are issues affecting the ability of custodians to execute cashflows, notably where assets are sub-custodied in Russia, then operational issues could prevent funds from trading effectively, leading to gating.'
Fitch said a surge in redemption requests could compound the situation, leading to a severe performance deterioration and, with the war intensifying, this becomes a much greater concern.
As seen at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, many funds may move to a swing-pricing model, which allows groups to respond to sale and purchasing activity. This is while broader funds with Russian exposure could also introduce 'extraordinary liquidity measures'.
Fitch added that increased market volatility, the rapid increase in oil prices, and other factors will create challenging conditions for mutual funds, particularly as inflation rises and rate rising cycles kick in.
'Energy-focused funds, for example, may experience increased volatility in the current market conditions. If fund managers navigate this market poorly and their funds underperform, they could face increased redemption requests. The challenging conditions may lead managers to shift their focus to asset retention from asset growth, particularly if securities prices decline.'

According to the note seen by Citywire Selector, the decision to suspend the funds was taken with immediate effect, which means any requests to buy, switch or redeem shares in either fund is now not being processed.
JPM AM said: 'Due to the escalating conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, normal market trading conditions have been significantly impaired, which in the view of the management company constitutes an emergency as a result of which disposal and valuation of investments of the fund is impracticable.'

'We understand that being unable to deal in the funds is frustrating and we will take the decision to lift the temporary suspension as soon as we consider it is in the best interests of existing shareholders to do so.'

2022-03-04,a2381517,Fidelity Adviser Solutions has taken tough action on the near PS1bn L&G EM Government Bond (US$) Index fund after conducting an exceptional meeting.,Liquidation of a fund,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Dylan Lobo,Revealed: Fidelity platform soft closes PS1bn L&G bond fund after emergency Russia meeting,"Fidelity has soft closed a giant passive bond fund on its investment platform following an emergency meeting to review funds with exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.
According to a note seen by Citywire Wealth Manager, Fidelity Adviser Solutions called an exceptional meeting for its Asset Range Governance Committee last night.
In the meeting, it assessed what action needed to be taken from a governance perspective for its unsuspended funds with exposure to the three countries.
As a consequence, it has decided to soft close the four share classes of the L&G Emerging Market Government Bond (US$) Index fund on its retail advised and direct-to-consumer platforms. The decision, which took effect today, does not affect its workplace pension platform.
Investors will still be able to sell their positions, but will not be able to make new subscriptions.
In a statement sent to Citywire, Fidelity International said: 'Fidelity has decided it is in the best interests of our Personal Investing and Adviser Solutions customers not to allow any new investments to some funds that have a significant exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus as a temporary measure. If customers hold these funds on our platform, they can still withdraw their money.'
The US dollar hard currency L&G EM Government Bond fund, which launched in December 2012, runs under just PS1bn in assets. The fund aims to provide income by tracking the performance of the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus.
According to its January factsheet, the fund had 9.3% exposure to Russia, with some of its top 10 holdings in Russian bonds, including its biggest holding, the Russian Eurobond 5.25% 23 June 47, which accounted for a 2.3% weighting.
As of 3 March, exposure to Russia had fallen to 3.6%, LGIM told Wealth Manager.
LGIM said the fund would continue to remain open for subscriptions and redemptions on other platforms.
'We have well-established liquidity frameworks and protocols in place with all our funds. This is just a decision taken by the Fidelity platform as per its own internal processes.'
It's not clear at this stage how many, if any, other funds will suffer the same fate as Fidelity continues to monitor the situation.
'We have not singled out L&G; there are many other funds from other providers that are being soft closed in this way,' Fidelity said in a note following last night's meeting.
Ratings agency Fitch estimates there is around PS2.5bn worth of assets currently locked in Russia and Russia-related strategies that have been forced to suspend due to the war in Ukraine.
In a statement issued on 1 March, Fitch indicated that a wave of gating or closure measures was likely for European mutual funds in the wake of the Moscow Stock Exchange being closed at the start of the week.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/revealed-fidelity-platform-soft-closes-1bn-landg-bond-fund-after-emergency-russia-meeting/a2381517,2
2022-03-09,a2381786,Carmignac soft closes European long/short strategy at EUR1.5bn,Soft closure,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Margaryta Kirakosian,The strategy run by Malte Heininger experienced a surge in popularity as investors looked to diversify exposure after positive equity gains in 2021.,"Carmignac has soft-closed its European long/short equity strategy, Citywire Selector has learned.
The Carmignac Long-Short European Equities and Carmignac Portfolio Long-Short European Equities funds are managed by Malte Heininger and have more than EUR1.5bn in assets under management.
When approached by Citywire Selector, the firm said the pick up in demand for European long/short funds started in the middle of 2021, before inflation fears occurred.
This was also the moment when both funds started outperforming the sector, in particular Carmignac Long-Short European Equities, which peaked with a 21.4% return in October 2021, compared with a 14.2% sector average.
Heininger (pictured) said investors have been looking for ways to diversify their exposure after a strong 2021 for equity markets.
'Additionally, the European market has seen significant dispersion which typically creates attractive opportunities for long/short funds,' he added.
Commenting on the impact of the Ukraine war on European stocks, Heininger said the main challenge will come from a macro-driven environment where company fundamentals are not put at the forefront of stock prices.
'Our net exposure management and ability to benefit from wide market dispersion could be creating some opportunities once the conflict stabilises,' he added.
According to Morningstar data, both funds were experiencing steady inflows throughout 2021 with February 2022 reaching a peak, with EUR219m going into Carmignac Portfolio Long-Short European Equities and EUR44.9m to Carmignac Long-Short European Equities.
Heininger's investment philosophy has not changed since he started managing the fund in early 2016.
'More recently, we generated alpha on single shorts in both 2020 and 2021, years where short alpha was quite challenging,' he said.
In 2021 some of the best gains came from the technology and consumer sectors, with Heininger singling out a European semiconductor company as one of the top contributors.
According to Morningstar, the fund's biggest performer in 2021 was Dutch semiconductor company ASML, which returned 117%. The second-best performer was ingredients and chemicals firm IMCD, which returned 80%.
The portfolio management team was also involved in several spin-offs such as Vivendi/Universal Music Group, Kinnevik/Zalando and Dell/VMware.
January this year was generally a more challenging month with some core long positions such as Puma, Universal Music Group and Sika losing more than 10%.
'January was an unusual setup where a significant quality selloff in Europe impacted many high-quality companies,' Heininger said.
However, the short book performed well, with positions such as Alphawave and Wise contributing positively to returns. Heininger wouldn't comment on the investment thesis behind his short positions, but said he initiated new shorts in Zalando and De Longhi at the same time.
He also topped up his exposure to Dutch insurance company ASR, which is a one of the few value names the team had in the portfolio for a long time.
'It has a very strong execution track record and overdelivered on its targets since the IPO, so it is a name that helped balance the portfolio from a factor point of view,' he said.
The Carmignac long/short European equity strategy is currently classified as Article 8 according to Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, with Heininger putting environmental and governance at the forefront.
The fund's factsheet zooms in on the biggest contributors from an ESG standpoint, with Puma being one of largest long holdings and an MSCI AAA-rated company.
'Puma played an instrumental role in creating the UN-convened Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action and in mobilising its suppliers, peers and partners in the industry and beyond to join this industry-wide collaboration platform on climate. The company also benefited from strong governance,' Heininger said.
Aside from Puma, the other four significant ESG holdings in the portfolio are Allianz, SAP, Danone and Microsoft.
The Carmignac Long-Short European Equities fund has returned 17.9% in euro terms over the last three years to the end of January 2022 and began to significantly outperform the sector average from July 2021. The Citywire's Alt Ucits - Long/Short Equity sector returned an average 11.6% over the same timeframe.
The Carmignac Portfolio Long-Short European Equities fund has returned 23.2% in euro terms over the last three years to the end of January 2022, picking up the pace from January 2021.

The Emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa fund stopped accepting new investments on 22 March due to liquidity issues as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The closure means no new money can be invested in the fund. Current investors can sell their positions, but will be unable to make new subscriptions.
The fund is managed by Nick Price, who had a Citywire AAA rating until January before he lost his rating in March, and Greg Konstantinidis, who also lost his rating in March.
According to Fidelity's website, the fund invests at least 70% in equities in 'less developed countries of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe (including Russia), Middle East and Africa'. Its factsheet for February shows it had 8.6% exposure to Russia, while Russian energy giant Gazprom was one of its top holdings.
Morningstar data shows the fund size fell to PS68m in February this year.
Its performance has been badly hit by the Ukrainian war. It is down 37.3% over the three months to the end of February, according to Citywire data, ranking it last in the 292-strong Global Emerging Markets category.
In a statement to our sister publication Citywire New Model Adviser, a spokesperson for Fidelity International said: 'The war in Ukraine has had a significant impact on market trading and liquidity conditions for Russian securities across some of our portfolios.
'It is always our duty to act in the best interests of all investors and ensure fair treatment. To do this, we need to make sure that all assets continue to be valued appropriately and that all trading activity on behalf of clients is done at a fair price.
'Given this - and having looked in-depth at the options available to us to protect the interests of existing shareholders - Fidelity International has decided to temporarily close the Fidelity Emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa fund (Oeic) to new subscriptions and switches in. Please note that existing investors in the fund can continue to redeem or switch out of the fund.
'The situation will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and we will update investors as soon as we're able to open the fund to new subscriptions and switches in.'
The fund was due to become the Fidelity Sustainable Emerging Markets fund, joining its range of sustainable funds that apply environmental, social and governance (ESG) related exclusions to ensure at least 70% of its funds' portfolios are invested in companies that maintain 'strong sustainable characteristics'.
However, the spokesperson said the change was postponed on 3 March due to 'increased volatility and deteriorating liquidity' due to the war in Ukraine.
'We feel this is prudent and in the best interests of existing investors given the potential challenges in trading Russian equities in order to realign the fund.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/fidelity-soft-closes-emerging-markets-fund-after-russian-holdings-plummet/a2383621,2

2022-04-13,a2385100,Abrdn flags 10 funds not offering value for money,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,,"Funds with more than APS2bn of assets flagged in latest aEUR~assessment of valueaEUR(tm) report, leading analysts to question whether the asset manager is doing enough to deal with lagging strategies.","Abrdn has flagged unacceptably poor performance at funds with more than PS2bn of combined assets in its latest 'assessment of value' report, leading analysts to question whether the FTSE 100 asset manager is doing enough to deal with lagging strategies.
In the report, 10 of the 76 open-ended funds considered received a cross by their names under performance, including the PS414m UK Value Equity and PS633m UK Income Unconstrained Equity funds.
Introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in 2019, the annual assessments compel asset managers to evaluate whether their own funds are delivering value for investors on key metrics like costs and returns, although they have been criticised for the lack of changes made as a result.
In the report, which does not cover Abrdn's entire fund range, Jamie Matheson, the independent chairman of Aberdeen Standard Fund Managers Limited, noted there had been 'steady improvement' for several strategies, partly as a result of previous remedial actions.
However, particular pressure appears to be building on the PS98m Global Focused Equity fund, managed by Donal Reynolds and Blair Couper.
Matheson, who has oversight of funds at the group, said the portfolio's 'performance has been disappointing and this follows multiple periods of suboptimal performance'.
In the year to the end of March, the fund lost 0.7% versus a 12.4% gain for the MSCI All Countries World index, according to Morningstar. Over five years it has delivered 26.4%, well behind the global benchmark's 64.7%, while shrinking as a result of outflows.
Matheson noted that Chinese holdings including Tencent and Alibaba had been major detractors in the year to the end of October, the period considered in the report, as the managers 'underestimated' Beijing's regulatory clampdown. But beyond getting some broad calls wrong, the chair said 'stock selection was a further drag on performance'.
Matheson said the fund has recently adopted a high-conviction strategy to drive performance, shifting from around 50 to 25 holdings. But he said the board was engaging closely with Abrdn to confirm suitable remedial actions on the fund and that these would be communicated to investors.
Sources: Morningstar; fund factsheets
Matheson, also a former chairman of wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, noted improving performance at some problem funds, particularly those with a bias towards cheaper 'value' stocks after the initial vaccine rally. However, he pointed out returns had started to flag again at some funds in the middle of last year.
Looking at performance on a one-year view from today rather than October, most funds have continued to lag their benchmarks.
Though disappointing over one year, a bumper bounce in late 2020 for the UK Value Equity fund, previously known as UK Unconstrained Equity, has helped manager Wes McCoy almost catch up with the benchmark over five years. Matheson also credited changes made after previous value assessments, including making sure the cyclical portfolio does not have an 'overly concentrated' investment style.
The FCA asks fund groups to assess value across seven 'pillars'. In addition to performance, Abrdn has distilled these down into two other areas: 'quality of service' and 'costs'. The group, which unlike some rivals assesses its funds across multiple reports rather than all at once, said all the funds considered had passed on those metrics.
The FCA released a damning report in July looking at how fund groups had implemented value assessments since their introduction in October 2019, saying many were failing to properly evaluate value or justify their assumptions.
Ryan Hughes (pictured), head of investment research at AJ Bell, said as we enter the third iteration of value assessments, the regime 'continues to underwhelm with little meaningful action seemingly resulting from these reports'.
'The FCA issued very strong comments last year that they expected better from asset managers and as yet there doesn't seem to be much evidence of it,' he said.
'The process allows asset managers to mark their own homework and it's little surprise that they tell investors they are either doing just fine or have a plan to do better when perhaps the better course of action would be to close the fund and give investors their money back.'
Speaking about Abrdn specifically, Hughes said there were signs that its fund range 'could do with a tidy-up'. He noted the group had just over 150 funds in Investment Association sectors and a 'remarkable' 43 of these have less than PS100m of assets, making them potentially sub-scale.
'I'm sure there is a strong argument for some of these to be closed or merged to try to give investors better outcomes,' said Hughes.
'But when funds [are] often profitable for asset managers at very low levels, there is often little incentive to go through this exercise.'
Discussing Abrdn's range of UK equity funds, several of which were highlighted in the assessment, a spokesperson said: 'The recent market rotation has caused a headwind for those strategies most focused on quality and growth and the fund board notes signs of improvement in performance where assessment of value has been ongoing.
'We believe that we have UK equity products to suit all investor needs.'
Abrdn also pointed to several UK funds ranking in the top quarter of their sectors for performance over three years, including McCoy's UK Value fund, ASI UK Income Equity run by Charles Luke and ASI UK Sustainable and Responsible Equity managed by Rebecca Maclean.",https://citywireselector.com/news/abrdn-flags-10-funds-not-offering-value-for-money/a2385100?section=wealth-manager,10

A-rated Nicholas Price (pictured) will step up as lead in Tano's place, with Tajima also acting as co-manager and Ying Lu as an assistant manager on the portfolio.
Tokyo-based Price is manager of Fidelity's Japan Aggressive fund but is probably better known to UK investors for running the Fidelity Japan (FJV) investment trust since September 2015.
The portfolio, which has significant positions in smaller companies and mid-caps, has been buffeted this year, leading Price to reassure shareholders after an 'extreme' growth stock sell-off.

In a note on the company's website, the Nordic group said its responsible investment committee had made the decision due to the sanctions placed on Russia, the aggression in Ukraine and the liquidity constraints created by the suspension of the Moscow Stock Exchange.
'Given the escalation of the conflict and challenges with the liquidity and settlement of the funds' investments, we do not consider reopening the funds to be in the best interests of shareholders, so this is not being contemplated.
'Moreover, the value of the total net assets of the funds is low and not expected to grow in the near future.'
The Danske Invest Sicav Russia fund was managed by sector specialist Olga Karakozova, who has 21 years of industry experience. The latest available factsheet for the fund indicates that it had $1.4m in assets under management, as of the end of April.
Ole Gotthardt managed the Danske Invest Sicav Eastern Europe fund, as well as the Denmark-domiciled equivalent. The Ucits-compliant version of the fund had $3.7m (EUR3.5m) in assets at the end of April.
It was not stated in the company documents whether the managers remained with the group following the closures. Danske Invest had not responded to a request for further information at the time of publication.
In a longer note, focused on the implications of the Ukraine invasion for the company, it said it was working to reduce or remove Russian exposure from funds not directly focused on the country.
'The following Danske Invest strategies include only a small number of Russian investments compared to total assets: Danske Invest Emerging Markets Debt, Danske Invest Emerging Markets, Danske Invest Emerging Markets Small Cap and Dansk Invest Index Emerging Markets Restricted, etc.

Bond will step down next year and has begun the process of formally handing over his Threadneedle UK Social Bond fund to deputy Tammie Tang next month. The managers have worked together since 2018. He will remain on the fund's advisory bond.

Bouchriha joins from Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management where he co-managed climate solutions funds. As part of his role at Candriam he will manage the strategy alongside Vincent Meuleman.
Bouchriha steps in following the departure of Koen Popleu and Monika Kumar, who both joined Lazard Asset Management at the end of last year.
The fund had EUR40m net outflows in the wake of the duo's exit, but recovered the assets quickly and currently has EUR1.04bn in assets under management, having grown from EUR400m in June 2020.
The strategy has returned 56.38% in US dollar terms over the last three years to the end of April, versus 35.33% from the MSCI ACWI NR benchmark.
An Edmond de Rothschild spokesperson told Citywire Selector Kevin Net continues to run the Edmond de Rothschild SICAV Green New Deal fund, which he co-managed with Bouchriha. The firm is currently hiring an additional manager for the strategy.
Aside from the new hire for its climate strategy, Candriam has also promoted its head of ESG development David Czupryna as lead fund manager on its circular economy fund.
His new role is a natural transition from his previous position as head of ESG development at Candriam, where he played a key part in developing the firm's ESG footprint and creating new thematic investment strategies.
Candriam's circular economy fund was launched in April 2020 and at the time was managed by Popleu and Kumar.
At the end of April this year the fund had EUR391m in assets under management. Since launch the strategy has returned 36.37% in US dollar terms, versus 40.2% from the MSCI ACWI NR.
As part of its sustainability drive, Candriam has also expanded its team in New York. The asset manager has hired Alexandra Russo into a newly-created role as head of ESG client portfolio management for the US and the UK.
She will be working with Candriam's in-house team of 22 ESG research and investment professionals and support the firm's capabilities across the US and UK with respect to key ESG strategies.
Meanwhile, Marie Niemczyk has been appointed as head of ESG client portfolio management, based in Paris. Niemczyk has been with the firm since 2018 as head of insurance relations.

2022-06-01,a2388853,Janus Henderson closes PS1bn property fund sale to mystery buyer,Hard closure,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Dylan Lobo,The APS1bn Janus Henderson Property fund has been sold to an undisclosed buyer.,"Janus Henderson has completed the sale of itsPS1bn propery fund to an undisclosed buyer.
The closure comes after the asset manager said it had found a buyer for the fund at the end of April.
According to previous reports, Elliot Management-backed Oval Real Estate and US private equity firms Ares Management, Blackstone, and Starwood Capital, along with Brookfield and British Land, had been linked with a bid for the open-ended portfolio.
A statement sent to Citywire Wealth Manager read: 'Janus Henderson can confirm that the sale of Janus Henderson
'UK Property PAIF's direct property portfolio has completed today (31 May 2022). We expect to be able to instruct the payment to return proceeds to investors on 16 June 2022, settling on 22 June 2022.'
The sale comes four months after Citywire Wealth Manager reported that CBRE had been hired to independently value the assets of the fund, which is co-managed by Marcus Langlands Pearse and Ainslie McLennan (pictured below), with a view to a possible sale.
The fund was suspended a few days later as the sale process began.
'Janus Henderson Group can confirm that the sale of the property assets of the Janus Henderson UK Property PAIF has now progressed to a point where we can begin the process of terminating the funds and planning for the return of proceeds to investors,' a statement sent to WM said.
'We can confirm that contracts have been exchanged with the selected single purchaser of the fund's direct property portfolio.
'The sale price is above the most recent independent valuation used to price the funds. We believe this provides a good outcome for investors given the ongoing uncertainty faced by daily-dealing property funds.'
The property portfolio sale process is expected to be completed in the week commencing 30 May.
Janus Henderson provided no details on the sale price.
The decision to sell the fund will raise questions over whether physical property funds can work in an open-ended structure.
The market was hit by a series of suspensions when the economy ground to a halt at the start of the pandemic in March 2020. At one point there was as much as PS20bn trapped in UK property funds.
When it was suspended on 18 March 2020, the Janus Henderson fund was valued at PS2bn. The suspension was lifted 10 months later as restrictions were eased on the back of the vaccine rollout. However, investors' loss of faith in the fund has resulted in assets halving to the current PS1bn level.
The events prompted the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to launch a widespread review of open-ended physical property funds to determine whether their structure has enough liquidity to meet redemptions in tough market conditions.
One of the proposals in the FCA's consultation paper was to introduce a 180-day waiting period for investors to get their money out to address the fundamental 'liquidity mismatch' in the sector.
Quilter Cheviot property research analyst Oli Creasey (pictured above) said the sale of the fund was not a surprise and that it is of some comfort that it has been sold above book value.
'We still don't know the exact circumstances that led to the sale, but the fact it is taking place above book value further reduces any concerns that this was some sort of distressed event,' he said.
'Given the likelihood that Janus Henderson is not a forced seller, we think it is unlikely the fund would transact at a price that does not produce a positive net return for shareholders.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/janus-henderson-closes-1bn-property-fund-sale-to-mystery-buyer/a2388853?section=wealth-manager,7
2022-06-01,a2388860,DWS's chief Woehrmann to resign over greenwashing allegations,Negative press,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Chris Sloley,Head of German groupaEUR(tm)s asset management operation to step down due to increased pressure placed on firm.,"DWS chief executive Asoka Woehrmann has resigned from the group due to the 'burden' placed on himself and his company over ongoing greenwashing allegations.
Woerhmann said: 'Today, after the three most successful years in its history, DWS is significantly more profitable, is stable and has continued to perform well in a difficult market environment.
'At the same time, the allegations made against DWS and myself in past months have become a burden for the company, as well as for my family and me. In order to protect the institution and those closest to me, I would like to clear the way for a fresh start.'
His resignation comes one day after the German asset manager's offices - as well as those of its parent company Deutsche Bank - were raided by police as part of an investigation into alleged greenwashing.
The DWS share price fell 7% from 31 May to 1 June, with the asset manager currently trading at EUR31 per share.
Woerhmann will step down at the group's annual general meeting next week (9 June). Stefan Hoops, formerly head of the corporate bank at Deutsche Bank, will take on the role.
Woerhmann's time as the CEO of the asset manager has been defined by greenwashing allegations, put forward by Desiree Fixler, the group's former sustainability chief, in August last year.
She claimed the firm overstated the degree to which it integrated sustainability. US regulator the SEC and German regulator Bafin launched an investigation into the firm's practices as a result.
Following the raid of Deutsche Bank's and DWS' offices, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office in Frankfurt told Citywire the examination so far showed that ESG factors were taken into consideration only for the minority of the firm's investments, contrary to the information in DWS funds' sales prospectuses.
In its 2021 annual report, the asset manager stated it was overseeing EUR115bn ESG assets, a significantly lower number compared with the EUR459bn of 'ESG integrated' assets it published a year earlier.
Woerhmann took on the CEO role in October 2018, when he succeeded Nicolas Moreau, who has since moved on to lead HSBC Asset Management. In a welcome memo from the time he joined, Woehrmann suggested his focus would centre on improving the value of the asset manager.",https://citywireselector.com/news/dws-chief-woehrmann-to-resign-over-greenwashing-allegations/a2388860?re=97769&ea=1735690&utm_source=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_medium=BulkEmail_Global_Daily&utm_campaign=BulkEmail_Global_Daily,2
2022-06-09,a2389493,Aviva Investors shuts high yield fund on mounting outflows,Liquidation of a fund,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Nicola Blackburn,Aviva Investors will close its High Yield Bond fund after the strategy saw three-and-a-half years of consecutive monthly outflows.,"Aviva Investors will close its PS56.2m High Yield Bond fund next month after the strategy experienced ongoing outflows since 2018.
The fund, managed by Citywire + rated Sunita Kara, will be closed to buys and sells on 12 July and formally shut on 19 July.
The closure follows a strategic review of the fund earlier this year after Aviva found it had not achieved its objective of beating its benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays Pan-European High Yield 2% Issuer Capped index, throughout 2021.
'The fund has not achieved its stated objective of beating the benchmark on a net basis,' Aviva said in the fund's 2021 assessment of value report.
'Although the fund has provided value to investors in a challenging market, performance is considered to be at the lower end of the range of expected outcomes for an actively managed fund of this nature.
'Consequently, the board has determined that a strategic review should be undertaken to determine whether further changes are required to the management of the fund, to ensure it can deliver value to investors over the long term.'
The PS56.2m fund has shrunk to a quarter of its 2016 size. It reached PS209.1m in assets under management in December that year, according to Morningstar.
It has suffered ongoing monthly outflows since October 2018, with investors pulling almost PS2m from the fund in the year to date.
However, the fund compares favourably with similar funds on performance. It has returned 8.2% in the three years to June, according to Morningstar, ahead of the 5.3% average for funds in Citywire's Sterling High Yield Bond sector.
Launched in 2008, the fund invests primarily in sub-investment grade bonds: 61.1% of its underlying bonds have a BB, or middling, credit rating, according to Aviva Investors.
A spokesperson for Aviva said investors had been notified of the fund's closure. It declined to comment further.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/aviva-investors-shuts-high-yield-fund-on-mounting-outflows/a2389493,5

Carlson and Psaila had overseen the Luxembourg-domiciled MS INVF Emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa fund since it was launched in 2003.
However, according to a shareholder note from 14 April, Morgan Stanley Investment Management opted to refocus the fund under the banner of the MS INVF NextGen Emerging Markets fund. This includes broadening its remit.
In addition, the group installed Steven Quattry and Jorge Chrinio as the new lead managers on 16 May 2022, according to a company notification. The duo have 18 and 16 years' industry experience, respectively.
Under the EUR51.9m fund's new remit, Quattry and Chrinio will be able to access both emerging and frontier market equities, as well as 'traditionally overlooked' markets that might sit beyond this scope. This universe may change over time but includes countries as varied as Albania to Algeria to Oman to Turkmenistan to Zambia, with a large number in between.
It will also operate with an overt ESG focus, which includes excluding companies involved in thermal coal mining, oil sands, Arctic oil and gas, tobacco, adult entertainment, gambling and weapons. Exclusions will be based on whether the associated stock generates a specific amount of revenue from these activities.
The latest available fund data indicates Poland (28.1%) and South Africa (21.9%) are currently the single largest country allocations. Capitec Bank Holdings, a South African retail bank, is the single largest stock position.
It is understood Carlson and Psaila remain with the firm despite the change and are named on other emerging market equity strategies.
The MS INVF NextGen Emerging Markets fund, as it is now known, has lost 4.6% in US dollar terms over the three years to the end of April 2022. This places it 23rd out of 25 funds in the Equity - Frontier Markets sector over this period, where the average return is 13.7%.",https://citywireselector.com/news/veteran-pair-step-off-emea-fund-amid-nextgen-rebrand/a2389400?re=97963&refea=1781405,4

Angus Hui (pictured) has relocated from Hong Kong to Singapore to take up the new role, effective today, and will manage the 18-strong fixed income team. He will also be tasked with expanding the group's range of fixed income strategies, as well as generating alpha and integrating ESG considerations into all portfolios.
Hui reports to Ken Goh, who was named chief investment officer in April, succeeding veteran Patrick Yeo who has been at the company for 17 years.
'This key appointment reflects the next leg of our journey,' said Ken Goh. 'Appointments of this calibre and experience reflect Fullerton's ambition and commitment to grow our already strong fixed income business.'
In his new role, Hui will also work closely with Ong Guat Cheng, who has been promoted to head of Asia fixed income from senior vice president and portfolio manager.
Hui comes with 25 years' industry experience, having risen through the ranks since joining the British asset manager in 2000. Prior to Schroders, he started his career in research roles at HSBC in Hong Kong, before moving to Standard & Poor's in Australia.
Hui's departure from Schroders prompted Morningstar to issue a note last month cautioning on the implications on the funds he was managing, although the fund ratings were kept unchanged on the news.

In its annual results to the end of September 2021, Crux's assets under management (AUM) dipped by PS300m, from close to PS1.9bn to PS1.6bn.
The PS631m European Special Situations strategy had net outflows of PS329.5m, while the PS55m European fund had net outflows of PS95.3m during the reporting period, according to Morningstar data.
Both funds are managed by Richard Pease and James Milne. Over three years the European Special Situations fund has returned 13.6% compared with a sector average of 26.9%.
The European strategy has returned 19.8% over the same period and also trails the same benchmark.
The dip in AUM contributed to a 19% loss in revenue, which dropped from PS14.1m to PS11.5m.
'The outflows were mainly due to a trend of investors moving away from collective investment schemes into segregated mandates for some multi-manager investors,' said Crux chief executive Karen Zachary (pictured below).
'Since then, we have seen investors changing their allocations from Europe to Asia ex-Japan and the UK.'
The asset manager's profit margin also fell from 19% to 11%, with pre-tax profits dipping from PS2.6m in 2020 to PS1.2m.
According to a spokesperson for the firm, pre-tax profits were lower than expected due to plans to diversify the business, and the hiring of four investment professionals last summer.
The staff include Ewan Markson-Brown, who was hired in June 2021 to manage the firm's recently launched Asia ex-Japan fund and its China fund.
Markson-Brown joined Crux from Baillie Gifford, where he ran the PS3bn Baillie Gifford Pacific fund alongside AAA-rated Roderick Snell.
Elsewhere, administrative costs were flat from 2020, at around PS9.5m, while the highest-paid director received PS417,000, down from PS439,000 in 2020.
Despite the loss in AUM, Crux plans to double its assets in two years from 2021 levels by diversifying its offering.
During the year, US boutique investment bank Stephens Incorporated purchased a 20% stake in the firm.
Zachary hopes the new partnership with Stephens will help return profits to 2020 levels.
'We are working on our new partnership with Stephens Inc to consider bolt-on acquisitions, including the hiring of new investment teams and strategies to diversify and grow the business,' she said.
'In addition, our UK Special Situations fund and our newly launched Asia ex-Japan fund continue to grow despite recent market turbulence, and we expect this trend will continue.'

The MSCI All Country World index (ACWI) also had the worst start to the year since the index's creation. The ACWI, which tracks 23 developed and 24 emerging market country stocks, was down 20% from 1 January to 30 June. By comparison, the index was down 9.9% in H1 2001 and down 10.4% in H1 2008.
Despite such headwinds, some strategies stood tall, albeit those at the riskier end of the scale. Alternative Ucits, the hedge fund-like strategies, dominate the top 10 best performers for European-domiciled mutual funds for the first half of the year.
Josef Heimann continues his success from Q1 2022, with the best-performing fund in H1 2022 being his Crocodile Capital Global Focus fund. This long/short strategy has its largest sector positions in energy and materials, with holdings including Rheinmetall and Lockheed Martin.
Sitting second is Crispin Odey on his Odey Swan fund, which returned 60.3% in euro terms. The renowned long/short investor excels in market downturns but struggles to keep pace in upswings. Over the last three years to June 2022, he returned 37% on the fund.
Most of his gains are from the last six months, with returns of 60.3%, and Q1 2021 where he returned 30.6%. Before this, he lost 27% in 2020 and the fund was down 13% in 2019 when markets were on an upswing. His top five positions include Pendragon, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Jadestone Energy, Barrick Gold and Norsk Hydro.
Systematic trend-following strategies are also pushed into the limelight in the first half, as the AQR Systematic Total Return fund returned 38.8%. This fund is managed by Andrea Frazzini, John J. Huss, Laura Serban and Yao Hua Ooi.
Its three-year returns to the end of July are 38.6%, but as with the Odey Swan fund they struggled through 2020 and 2019 with the positive returns only starting in January 2021.
Also making the list are David Kitson and Leda Braga, who co-run the Schroder GAIA BlueTrend fund, as well as the ASG Managed Futures fund, which is managed by Alexander Healy, Philippe Ludi, and Robert Sinnott.
These managed futures and systematic trend funds have strong diversification benefits in down-trending markets and a great tactical allocation. However, a word of caution: at the first glimmer of growth, these strategies tend to falter.
These are great tactical positions in market downturns but are not all-weather funds. The extra due diligence that needs to go into selecting these funds is paramount, as not everyone will be comfortable with derivative strategies.
On the flip side, US growth equities and technology stocks have been the worst hit in performance terms, with tech titans such as Tesla, Apple, Meta and Netflix falling sharply over the first half.
The high-growth strategies of 2020 and 2021 no longer occupy centre stage, as the S&P 500 had its worst June since 2018 and its worst Q2 since 1970. To top it off, it was the worst start to a year since 1962.
Baillie Gifford's American fund has had an abrupt first half of 2022 with dismal performance. The fund, managed by Gary Robinson, Tom Slater, Kirsty Gibson and Dave Bujnowski, is down 50.4% over the first six months of 2022.
Growth has generally struggled against value so far this year and this growth portfolio is no different. The fund holds positions in Tesla (8%), Amazon (6%), Nvidia (3.6%) and 33% of the portfolio is invested in IT, which is where a huge chunk of underperformance has come from.
The managers do take a five-to-ten-year view in asset allocation and, despite the recent underperformance, returned 13.8% over three years. In 2020, the fund returned 110% which shows how quickly the tide has turned for growth strategies.
The Nikko AM ARK Disruptive Innovation also had a stellar 2020, returning 127% in euro terms, but posted negative returns in each quarter - except Q2 2021 - since the start of 2021.
There has been a recent personnel change on the fund with April's addition of Catherine Dine, who co-manages the fund with Takeshi Noda having replaced Lawrence Prager. Performance detractors in June came from Coinbase, Tesla, Unity Software and Block, which all underwent a period of strong downward pressure
With Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Eastern European stocks are still bearing the brunt of market sentiment. The Fidelity Emerging Europe Middle East & Africa fund, managed by Nick Price, is down 51.8% in H1 2022.
Former industry leader Jan Beckers remains in the bottom 10 with his BIT Global Internet Leaders Sicav, which was the best-performing fund in 2020. The fund lost 50.3% in euro terms in the first half of this year. However, over the past three years, the fund is up 193.1%.
It is important to reiterate that most of the worst-performing funds in H1 2022 have good long-term returns, especially in the US sector, which is a reminder that investors need to look for the long haul.

Esterer is tasked with developing the firm's sustainable investment processes and building a bridge between the investment teams and the sustainability analysts to enhance its ESG integration. A JSS spokesperson did not specify Esterer's new title.
Esterer has spent the past nine years as head of core equities and manager of the JSS Sustainable Equity - Europe fund. He managed the JSS Sustainable Equity - SDG Opportunities fund from 2020. JSS confirmed that he stepped back from his fund management responsibilities on 1 July.
The new head of core equities is Christoph Lang, who has been the head of core Europe and Switzerland since 2018. Lang has managed the firm's European and Swiss funds since 2013.
Jean-Charles Belvo has replaced Esterer as the manager of the SDG Opportunities fund.

2022-07-08,a2391948,GAM streamlines bond funds after strategic review,Hard closure,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,,"Swiss fund house to focus efforts on high-conviction and high-alpha products, Citywire has learned.","GAM has undertaken a strategic review of its fixed income offering and called time on six strategies which have a combined EUR168m (PS142m) in assets under management.
According to a memo seen by Citywire Wealth Manager's sister site Citywire Italia, the Swiss group has opted to focus its attention on funds it deems to be of high conviction and high-alpha generation.
Explaining the rationale for the review, GAM said: 'In an environment of normalizing interest rates, which will see shorter investment cycles, greater political uncertainty and higher yields, we have conducted a strategic review of our fixed income assets.
'GAM has decided to focus its fixed income investment expertise on strategies and products that can meet the needs of clients in this new environment.'
This ultimately means efforts will centre on catastrophe bonds, emerging markets, mortgage-backed debt and credit, as well as its recently launched sustainability-focused funds.
The group said it would not rule out launching more products in fixed income in the future, but it would be those deemed to meet evolving client needs in a more volatile market.
A spokesperson for GAM confirmed the note but said it would not be naming or confirming any of the managers involved. 'As a result of the liquidation, 6 FTE (full-time equivalent), based in the UK and in the US, will be impacted.
'We are seeking to integrate or redeploy these team members within GAM where possible. In accordance with local requirements, GAM will comply with the obligations of consultation periods, when notices are given,' the spokesperson added.
The group also stressed that the collective assets of the funds being liquidated amounted to less than 1% of total group AUM, while only making up a small proportion of the CHF12bn (PS10.3bn) it runs in fixed income strategies.
According to Citywire's database and the latest fund factsheets, the manager most affected by the closures is Jack Flaherty, who is head of credit strategies at the group. In total three of his funds, which cover global high yield, total return bonds and dollar bonds are set to close.
Meanwhile, two strategies overseen by GAM veteran Christof Stegmann will close, which cover the inflation-linked bond market and a more diversified income approach. The sixth fund is run by GAM's broader credit team, with Andrew Dewar and Mark Pearce named as managers by Citywire.

2022-07-11,a2392099,Ninety One moves long-standing multi-asset head to research team,Portfolio manager change,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,,"Philip Saunders, co-head of multi-asset growth for the past two decades, has moved to the Ninety One Investment Institute.","Ninety One's Philip Saunders has stepped down as co-head of multi-asset growth and fund manager of the global strategic-managed and risk-managed strategies, Citywire Selector has learned.
Saunders (pictured) ran the growth focused part of Ninety One's multi-asset team for nearly two decades.
He joined the firm - then known as Investec - in 1998, when it acquired Guinness Flight Global Asset Management, where Saunders was a co-founding director.
In 2000, he joined the multi-asset team and he became its head in 2004.
Saunders stepped down from the Ninety One GSF Global Strategic Managed fund and the Ninety One GSF Global Multi-Asset Sustainable Growth fund, including its sub-funds, on 30 June 2022.
A Ninety One spokesperson told Citywire Selector that Saunders will focus on his role as director of Ninety One's Investment Institute. They did not specify the reason for his departure from the strategies.
'[Saunders] will continue to be an integral part of the multi-asset team through his valued guidance and input into the multi-asset team's structural and cyclical macro research, which is the foundation of the team's asset allocation thinking,' the spokesperson said.
Over a five and three-year period, Saunders' performance has been in the bottom tier of fund managers tracked in the Citywire Mixed Assets - Aggressive GBP sector.
He returned 5.8% over a three-year period ending May 2022, vs. a 17.3% sector average. Over a one-year period ending May 2022, Saunders's performance has dipped to -5.4% compared to a -1.3% sector average.
The Discovery Global Multi-Asset fund, which Saunders has managed independently since August 2020, has underperformed the Citywire Flexible ZAR sector average by at least 10 percentage points since November 2020 over a three-year period ending May 2022, by which point the fund returned 6.5% compared to a sector average of 27.7%.
Saunders will be succeeded by Iain Cunningham as co-head manager of the multi-asset growth operation alongside co-portfolio manager Michael Spinks.
Cunningham and Saunders have worked together on the Ninety One Global Strategic Managed FF fund, which has outperformed the Citywire Balanced USD sector average over the three years to the end of May 2022. The strategy returned 22% in May, compared with a 15% sector average.
The spokesperson added: 'Iain [Cunningham] joined Ninety One in 2016 and has since then demonstrated his investment leadership through his role as manager of the Global Macro Allocation strategy and as co-manager of our Global Strategic Managed strategy. Both strategies have built strong track records.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/ninety-one-moves-long-standing-multi-asset-head-to-research-team/a2392099?refea=1781405,5
2022-07-12,a2392103,Schroders to split Emerging Europe fund to silo Russian exposure,Changes in the regulatory framework,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Chris Sloley,Fund house intends to reorganise assets in suspended strategy and reveal first calculated NAV since freezing trading.,"Schroders intends to split its Emerging Europe, which would effectively silo its direct exposure to Russian equities, Citywire Selector has learned.
The Schroder ISF Emerging Europe fund was one of several strategies to suspend trading in late February and early March following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. The suspension of the Moscow Stock Exchange meant accurate calculation of asset values was challenged as a result.
While some firms have opted to liquidate funds that had previously been suspended, Schroders is seeking to create new share classes that would reflect different holdings. According to a shareholder letter seen by Citywire Selector, these changes would come into effect on 18 July.
In the letter, Schroders said the management board had reviewed the strategy and looked at the best ways to preserve the remaining value of the fund, as well as allowing for the future value of any Russian assets to be taken into consideration.
Therefore, it will create two share classes - covering institutional and all non-institutional investors - which will retain exposure to Russian assets. These will be euro-denominated but remain closed for both subscriptions and redemptions.
Schroders said this ring-fencing mechanism does not mean a legal separation of assets and liabilities between share classes, but an accounting segregation between share classes will be taken into account. It stated that, given the fact the Russian assets are unleveraged, there is limited concern about liabilities exceeding the original value of these investments.
Schroders said the existing investment philosophy and objectives used by co-managers Mohsin Memon and Rollo Roscow would remain unchanged as a result of the split. Company documents for the fund, which has EUR576m in assets, do not currently highlight how much of the fund is directly invested in Russian assets.
As part of the note, Schroders said it would revisit the structure at the stage that Russian markets begin to trade normally. It said the realisation of value in Russian assets would be made at a fund level but separately from the non-Russian assets.",https://citywireselector.com/news/schroders-to-split-emerging-europe-fund-to-silo-russian-exposure/a2392103?refea=1781405,5

In his new position, Clavel, who will be based in Paris, will have the mission to lift the investment, commercial and financial performance of the platform.
Clavel, who reports to Axa IM Core's global Hans Stoter, joined the French firm in 2015 as an international economist. In October 2019, he was appointed head of Axa IM's quant lab.

2022-07-18,a2392635,GAM assets drop CHF 16.6bn with hefty writedown imminent,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,John Schaffer,The Swiss firm is set to announce a CHF 264m writedown related to Julius BaeraEUR(tm)s acquisition of the firm in 2005.,"GAM's assets under management (AUM) dropped by CHF 16.6bn (EUR16.8bn) in the first half of 2022, as negative market performance hurt the Swiss firm.
Total AUM for the group stood at CHF 83.2bn at the end of H1, compared with CHF 99.8bn at the end of December.
Due to the slide in AUM, GAM is expected to report a writedown of CHF 264m related to Julius Baer's acquisition of the firm in 2005.
The hefty writedown figure would result in a first half net loss of CHF 275m compared with a net loss of CHF 2.7m for the same period last year.
On an underlying basis, pre-tax losses reached CHF 15m in H1, compared with CHF 0.8m profit for the first half of 2021.
The asset management group said in a statement that 80% of the reduction in AUM was due to CHF 12.4bn of negative market movements paired with CHF 0.7bn of foreign exchange movements.
Net outflows in H1 amounted to CHF 3.6bn, with CHF 1.1bn pulled from investment management, and CHF 2.5bn withdrawn from its fund management services division.
Despite the AUM announcement, the firm's share price was up 8% at 9am CEST.
Peter Sanderson (pictured), CEO of GAM Investments said: 'During the first half of 2022 we have seen extraordinary economic and geopolitical conditions having a significant impact on markets.
'As a result of this volatility, clients have been exercising greater caution. Despite this, we are encouraged to see improving resilience in our flows with clients allocating to a number of our high conviction active strategies designed to help them navigate this challenging environment.'
Funds that have been squeezed particularly hard this year include the Star Credit Opportunities strategy, which has seen net outflows of EUR626m across its euro and dollar-denominated versions.
Over three years the fixed income fund has lost 1% compared with a sector average loss of 2.5%.
The Multibond Local Emerging Bond fund has also suffered EUR188m of net outflows in 2022. However, over 12 months investor redemptions have amounted to nearly EUR1.2bn.
The fund, managed by Paul McNamara, has lost 18.7% over three years compared with a sector average loss of 13.9%.
Earlier this month GAM undertook a strategic review of its fixed income offering, as it attempts to focus efforts on high-conviction and high-alpha products.
The latest AUM update marks further woes for the Swiss asset manager after it was fined PS9.1m in March by the FCA over a failure to manage conflicts of interest related to its former bond star Tim Haywood.
GAM is due to release its full H1 update on 3 August.

The long-serving fund manager began his career in 1970 and has established his own investment house, Shiozumi Asset Management.
It was through this venture he had formed a long working relationship with Legg Mason and, more recently, Martin Currie, where he had run the FTF Martin Currie Japan Equity fund since 2020.
In response to his planned retirement, Martin Currie - which is now owned by Franklin Templeton - intends to build its own, in-house Japan equity capabilities. Albeit with Shiozumi retaining an advisory role for a 12-month period.
Spearheading this offering will be Reiko Mito (pictured), who joins from Swiss group GAM. Mito had been a named manager on both the GAM Multistock Japan Equity and GAM Star Japan Leaders funds during her 11 years with the asset manager.
Mito, who will formally join on 25 August 2022, assumes the newly created role as head of Japan equity strategy and research within Martin Currie. In this capacity, she will work closely with Paul Danes, who is based in Singapore on the FTF Martin Currie Japan Equity fund.
Danes is named across a host of Asia Pacific equity funds within the Legg Mason/Franklin Templeton funds diaspora. He has over 18 years of experience in Japanese research and is also fluent in Japanese.
Mito will report to Michael Browne, who is global head of investment strategy and oversight at Martin Currie. Commenting on the new development, Browne said: 'Her appointment demonstrates our commitment to investing in new talent to support our long-standing ambition in this space, and I look forward to working with the new Japan equity team.'
Shiozumi has not been rated since February 2022, however, prior to that, he went 30 consecutive months with a rating in recognition of his strong, risk-adjusted performance in Japanese equities.
In terms of recent performance, the FTF Martin Currie Japan Equity fund sits 187 out of 188 funds on a 12-month absolute return basis to the end of June 2022. This is with a loss of 33.2% over this timeframe, which compares to a sector average loss of 5.5%.

Geffen will continue to lead the global equity team. James O'Connor and Dan Ekstein will continue to work on the strategy.
Over three years, the Income fund has returned 1.5%, trailing behind the sector average of 3.7%. In the first half of the year, the fund registered net outflows of PS34m, according to Morningstar data.
The firm's UK Equity Income fund, managed by Field and Ekstein, will now apply a 'more flexible investment process', away from its current mid-cap bias.

'One epoch ends and another begins,' Forssmed wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing the departure.
He spent two decades at Swedbank Robur, starting as a trader in 2002 before advancing to head of trading in 2005 and commodities portfolio manager in 2007.
Most notably, Forssmed has overseen the SEK 14bn (EUR1.3bn) Swedbank Robur USA fund since 2016.
The fund outperformed the Citywire US Blend sector average every month over the past five years, as of the end of June 2022, with returns reaching as high as 148% in December 2021 compared with a sector average of 82.1%.

2022-08-15,a2394906,Trojan Income: How we intend to come back from PS747m outflow,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Christopher Johnson,Blake Hutchins of Troy Asset Management is bullish on the consumer staples sector as he feels these companies will help his PS1.9bn fund beat the market again in the long term.,"The UK is facing a bleak economic outlook as the cost-of-living crisis continues to squeeze household incomes and is forecast to fall into a recession by year-end.
Blake Hutchins, manager of the Trojan Income fund, has suffered alongside the broader volatility in UK shares. The fund is down 0.6% over the last three years, versus a peer average return of 6.7%.
Clients have taken heed, with the fund reporting PS747m in net outflows in the last year according to Morningstar data, with total assets falling to PS1.9bn.
Hutchins (pictured) is confident that his quality approach to equity income can help turn that around, however. This approach has led him to an overweight position of 29% in the consumer staples sector, compared with 15% in the FTSE All Share and 20% in the FTSE 100.
One company Hutchins is bullish on is Diageo (DGE), the multinational alcoholic beverage company, which makes up 6.7% of the fund.
The company reported net sales growth of 21.4% over the year to July, as customers continued to consume its most expensive drink categories despite higher prices due to inflation.
'Diageo is the world's biggest premium spirits company and there is currently a trend for people to drink more spirits at the expense of beer and wine. People generally are drinking a little bit less but they are drinking at a higher quality,' he said.
Diageo has established a name for itself for its hundred-year history of distilling premium scotches such as Johnnie Walker and Buchanan's.
Hutchins is particularly energised by the take-off of the firm's tequila portfolio in recent years following Diageo's 2017 acquisition of Casamigos, the premium tequila brand co-founded by George Clooney, for around $1bn.
'There were quite a lot of eyebrows raised when they bought Casamigos. But since Diageo bought it, they have taken that brand and really grown it exponentially. Tequila has moved on from the kind of nasty drink that was occasionally shotted on the dance floor after 1 am to being a matured liquid that is super premium.'
In late July, Unilever (ULVR) replaced Diageo as the fund's top holding at 7.7% of fund assets.
The manufacturer of everything from soap to cereals has suffered lacklustre growth with its share price dropping 12.4% over the past five years, versus a 2.2% decline in the FTSE 100.
The company also faced public humiliation as its PS50bn bid for GlaxoSmithKline's consumer health arm Haleon was rejected by the pharmaceutical company.
Hutchins believes Unilever is now on the right track as Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, has taken a 1.5% stake in the business.
'Unilever, having had a bit of a crisis earlier this year, have come out after that saying large [acquisitions] are off the table.
'On top of that, you have Nelson Peltz, who is going to be very aligned with us and Unilever's interests of making sure that the performance does improve. It's encouraging and has resulted in me buying more shares of the company,' he said.
For Hutchins, Unilever's shares are reasonably lowly valued in comparison to brands such as Diageo. He also points to Unilever's recent history of achieving double-digit growth in emerging markets.
'It was doing very healthy low- to mid-single-digit volume growth. But the number of products that they sell recently has been flat. If you have brands that people want and you've managed your brands well, you should be growing better than that,' he said.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/news/trojan-income-how-we-intend-to-come-back-from-747m-outflow/a2394906,4

2022-09-27,a2398345,Fitch downgrades Jupiter as outflows mount,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,John Schaffer,"Worse could be set to come for Jupiter after PS13.4bn was pulled from its funds over the last four years, the ratings agency has warned.","Fitch Ratings has downgraded its outlook on Jupiter (JUP) from 'stable' to 'negative', as it believes the struggling UK fund house is increasingly sensitive to further outflows.
The credit rating agency has placed Jupiter's long-term issuer default rating (IDR) at BBB, with its subordinated debt given a BBB- rating.
By mid-afternoon, Jupiter's shares were down 2.8% at 91.4p, on a flat day for the wider market.
Jupiter's net flows have been negative over the past four years, with investors pulling PS13.4bn from UK domiciled open-ended funds over this period, according to data from Morningstar.
Fitch said that the fund group was at a greater risk due to its smaller scale and more concentrated business profile than competitors.
Management has sought to diversify geographically into the US, Chinese and Australian markets, striking a strategic distribution partnership with US investment firm NZS Capital. It also inherited a relationship with the Chinese financial services firm Ping An via the Merian acquisition.
While the 2020 acquisition of Merian added PS16.6bn in assets under management and diversified Jupiter's strategies, Fitch notes the fund firm's exposure to the UK and equities remains concentrated at 71% and 55% respectively as at the of its 2021 financial year.
'Fitch assesses Jupiter's risk controls as robust but its high-conviction strategies and the high proportion of assets under management (AUM) dedicated to equities inherently increases its risk profile,' the ratings agency said in a statement.
'Jupiter has witnessed net outflows over recent years, which continued in [the first half of 2022] and its retail focus and smaller scale increase its vulnerability to net outflows versus peers. However, Jupiter's relatively low leverage is a rating strength.'
Fitch also pointed to Jupiter's retail focus as a source of pain in terms of the volatility of investor flows.
However, the ratings agency did acknowledge that some of the firm's newer strategies had seen inflows over the last four years, which it described as a positive sign.
It also credited its strategic aim to expand the institutional client base to 20% of AUM over the medium term from the current 10%.
'[We] believe that this will be positive for the stability of net flows as Jupiter's retail focus can lead to volatile flows during periods of market uncertainty, although the larger-sized institutional mandates can also result in uneven flows,' Fitch said.
The downgrade reflects a period of significant pressure for the asset manager, with assets falling PS12bn in the first half of the year.
Profit in the six months to the end of June fell by 62% due to a combination of rising costs and a PS3.6bn net outflow that caused AUM to fall 19% to PS48.8bn.
Administrative expenses shot up 15% to PS160.2m in the first half, while staff costs surged 53% to PS63.9m. The firm's share price has slumped by more than 65% this year to 92p a share.
It was reported last week that incoming CEO Matthew Beesley (pictured), who is replacing Andrew Formica on 1 October, is said to be cutting 80 jobs at the firm.
Despite the Fitch downgrade, Jupiter's only drawn debt is PS50m of subordinated notes, issued in April 2020 due to regulatory capital requirements on the acquisition of Merian.
At the end of 2021, the notes were more than 3 times covered by cash of PS194m.
Jupiter also holds a PS80m revolving credit facility for back-up liquidity. but this remained undrawn throughout 2021.
Over the past year the PS1.5bn UK Mid Cap fund has been the hardest hit, with net outflows of PS576m. Investors have pulled more than PS1.2bn from the strategy since the end of August 2018.
Managed by Richard Watts, the fund has lost 16% over a three-year period, lagging far behind the sector average gain of 2.9%.
Watts has been in hot water recently over his bet on unlisted digital bank Starling, due to the holding pushing the fund's allowed limit for unquoted holdings.
Earlier this month Jupiter was reported to be selling its Starling stake at a big discount to its previous valuation.
Elsewhere, the PS3.4bn European fund has experienced net outflows of PS422m over 12 months, increasing outflows to PS2.9bn over a four year period.
Managed by Mark Heslop and Mark Nichols, the fund has returned 3.3% over three years compared with the peer group's 12.7% return. The past 12 months have been particularly painful, with the fund down 18.7%.
Another casualty has been the PS1.5bn Jupiter Merian North American Equity fund, with investors pulling PS349m from the fund over a year.
The strategy moved over to Jupiter in 2020 after Merian Global Investors was acquired by the fund firm.
Managed by Amadeo Alentorn, the fund has been a solid performer over three years, returning 44.8% versus the sector's 36.1% return.
Despite the positive performance, outflows have amounted to PS2.2bn since the end of August 2018.

Christensen spent nearly eight years at Danske Bank AM, joining as a senior portfolio manager in 2014. Before this, he occupied portfolio manager and equity analyst roles at several heavyweight Nordic names, including Nordea Markets and BankInvest.
At Danske Bank AM, Christensen had co-managed the DKK 21bn (EUR2.8bn) Luxembourg-domiciled Danske Invest Global Sustainable Future fund since its launch in 2020.
The fund returned 17.3% over a three-year period ending in August 2022, slightly above the average performance in the Citywire Equity - Global Blend category during the same period (14.5%).
In a LinkedIn post announcing his departure, Christensen said the fund is ranked number four among the 10 largest Article 9 strategies in Europe based on net returns.
But Christensen's eight years at Danske Bank AM have also been marked by challenges.
In 2018, two of his funds - Danske Invest Europe Long-Short Dynamic and Europe Long-Short Dynamic Plus - closed due to profitability reasons and limited investor interest.
In a shareholder note explaining the liquidation of the Europe Long-Short Dynamic Plus fund, Danske Invest said assets had decreased below a minimum level for such a fund to be operated economically and efficiently.
The fund went from EUR94.1m in April 2016 to EUR3.1m in assets at the end of July 2018, shortly before the fund was liquidated on 10 August later that year.
It had lost 4.5% in euro terms over three years ending in June 2018, whereas the average fund in the Citywire Equity - Europe sector returned 6.1% over the same period.

Olsen, head of listed equity impact at the asset manager, will take over responsibility for the M&G Climate Solutions and M&G (Lux) Climate Solutions fund, which are the UK- and Luxembourg-domiciled versions of the same strategy. Jasveet Brar will support Olsen on the funds.
Meanwhile, Ben Constable Maxwell will continue to act as impact lead on the team's impact fund range, which he helped to develop with Olsen in 2018.
The company said Somel, who was handed the climate-focused fund in November 2020, has decided to leave the asset management industry to take up a corporate role. He had been with the firm since joining as a fund manager's assistant in 2005.

Rae has 17 years' financial services experience and will move to support the Climate Solutions strategy. He had already been working closely with the sustain & impact, broader equities and catalyst teams on energy renewables and related stocks and topics.
M&G said there would be no alterations to the aims, objectives or policies of the fund.
Fabiana Fedeli, chief investment officer for equities and multi-asset at M&G, said: 'John William and the wider impact team continue to be instrumental in developing our impact investment approach within equities and will be ably supported on this strategy by Michael's extensive knowledge and experience in the renewables and energy sector.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/mandg-hands-climate-funds-to-impact-chief-as-pm-exits/a2399821?re=101908&refea=1887543,4

The figure, which accounts for active and passive strategies registered in the UK, underlines the intensity of the decline in sentiment following the mini-Budget on 22 September, which set out to increase spending without providing for funding - a stance Liz Truss's government has now been forced to row back on with Jeremy Hunt replacing Kwasi Kwarteng as Chancellor.
A total of PS8bn flowed out of equity funds, eclipsing August's PS5.2bn exodus, the worst month of net outflows on record at the time, according to the data group.
Funds focused on more expensive 'growth' stocks lost the most money, in a continuation of recent trends.
'Growth equity strategies dominated the outflows, while Ruffer's two vehicles, which have the lowest equity exposure in their history, remained in inflow mode,' said Morningstar analyst Jack Fletcher-Price.
The multi-asset Baillie Gifford Diversified Growth fund was one of the worst hit, with PS285m exiting in September, bringing the total outflow over the last year to nearly PS1.9bn.
The TM Ruffer Portfolio and recently-launched LF Ruffer Diversified Return funds took in PS49m and PS123m, respectively, over the month as they held up well in a volatile backdrop.
US asset management giant BlackRock experienced heavy outflows. Investors took a net PS2.4bn out of BlackRock funds in September. In terms of next worst-hit groups PS1.6bn was pulled from Royal London and PS1.5bn from Edinburgh-based Baillie Gifford.
Fletcher-Price noted that some sterling bond sectors saw inflows despite rising yields as bond prices slumped. Sterling government bond funds recorded PS817m net inflows and their inflation-linked counterpart recorded PS283m.
Turning to other categories, Allocation 60-80% Equity received net inflows, totalling PS172m and the sterling corporate bond - short term received PS158m.
On the other side of the coin, the US Large-cap Blend Equity and UK Large-cap Equity's sector both learked just under PS1.6bn.

The Kempen (Lux) Sustainable Europe Small-Cap I, Kempen (Lux) Euro Sustainable Credit J
and Kempen (Lux) Global Sustainable Equity I EUR funds were downgraded in August, a Kempen spokesperson confirmed. The change has been communicated to clients.
The funds have EUR872.25m in combined assets as of 30 September 2022, out of which the Kempen (Lux) Euro Sustainable Credit J fund is the largest with EUR770.54m in assets.
A Kempen spokesperson said that Van Lanschot Kempen initiated the change to provide 'full transparency to clients' regarding SFDR level 2 which is due to come into effect on 1 January 2023.
They said that while the sustainable funds have 'strong ESG characteristics', such as carbon reduction policies in line with climate transition and Paris-aligned benchmarks, the 'broad, diversified funds do not solely invest in sustainable economic activities under the SFDR definition'.
'After SFDR level 1 introduced in March 2021, a lot more clarity has been provided on the exact requirements for Article 9 funds by regulators and industry organisations.
'We therefore think Article 8 is more appropriate [for these funds], while Article 9 funds would be more suitable for more focused impact funds or thematic funds that can show full exposure to the SFDR definition of sustainable economic activities.

The fund's total net assets dropped from EUR125.55m to EUR27.37m in the year to 30 September 2022, according to Morningstar data. As of 21 October, the fund's net asset value (NAV) had fallen further to EUR20.75m, a MainFirst spokesperson told Citywire Selector.
The decision to liquidate was taken after a 'significant investor decided to reduce his overall emerging markets exposure', the spokesperson said, which 'accordingly affected the assets of the MainFirst Emerging Markets Credit Opportunities fund'.
'In these circumstances and considering the currently adverse market conditions and the low market liquidity, MainFirst considered the liquidation of the fund the most equitable solution for all investors,' the spokesperson told Citywire Selector.
The issue and redemption of shares of the sub-fund were suspended on 19 October and shareholders were informed of the liquidation request on 21 October, the spokesperson confirmed.
The relevant NAV will 'continue to be calculated' and published daily until the liquidation and dissolution of the sub-fund has been carried out. The board of directors estimates that 30% of the securities in the portfolio are '(potentially) illiquid' and that 'it is currently not possible to estimate when the complete disposal can be expected', according to a shareholder note seen by Citywire Selector.
The first tranche of the liquidation proceeds will be paid out after the disposal of all liquid assets, and the second tranche after the completion of the disposal of all 'potentially illiquid' securities. All costs associated with the liquidation will be charged to the sub-fund's remaining assets.

He was appointed vice-chair in 2014 and stepped down from the board in May 2021 to give him more room to focus on his external appointments.
Since relinquishing his board seat, Bonham Carter has focused on assisting with the firm's stewardship and corporate responsibility activities. Following his departure, these responsibilities will be absorbed by Jupiter's corporate sustainability and stewardship teams.
'After 28 years with Jupiter, and over 40 in the investment industry, now is the right time for me to step away from the business to focus on my other interests and appointments,' Bonham Carter said.
'I am proud of all that Jupiter has achieved during my time with the company, all the while maintaining what sets it apart - a dedication to active investment management, which I firmly believe still has a key role to play in the investment industry.'
Jupiter chief executive Matthew Beesley added: 'I have had the pleasure of working with Edward during my time as CIO, and more recently CEO of Jupiter.
'The contribution he has made to the company over almost three decades is clear, not least in his most recent role in which he has helped us to evolve our approach towards stewardship, adding valuable leadership and perspective.'
Bonham Carter's investment career started in 1982. He joined Jupiter in 1994 as a UK fund manager and was appointed chief investment officer in 1999. He became joint chief executive in 2000 and group CEO in 2007.

Morningstar identified 342 funds that upgraded their status. The vast majority (315) moved from Article 6 to Article 8.
Some reclassifications occurred ahead of the introduction of the Level II SFDR disclosures that will come into force in January. These will require asset management firms to fill out the European ESG template with various sustainable indicators.

According to a shareholder note on the company's website, the German asset manager wrote to clients at the end of October outlining plans to wind up the MainFirst - Euro Value Stars, which came into effect on 7 November.
This strategy was originally launched as a Luxembourg-domiciled fund called MainFirst Classic Stock. It was overseen by the experienced team of Hans-Peter Schupp, Evy Bellet and Olgerd Eichler. Schupp stepped down in 2007 and was replaced by Thorsten Graf.
Those managers were replaced in 2015 by Thomas Meier (pictured), the firm's head of equity fund management, and Christos Sitounis.
MainFirst then rebranded and refocused the fund as Euro Value Stars in a bid to better reflect its emphasis on low-value, high-growth companies in the eurozone. It had EUR67m in assets at the time.
The fund ranks in the middle of its peer group in terms of three-year total returns, returning 4.9% in euro terms against an Equity - Eurozone sector average of 2.7%. Its one-year figures are less encouraging, having lost 26.5% over the past 12 months, which means it ranks 446th out of 461 active strategies.
It is understood that Meier and Sitounis, who both work in the equity dividend unit, remain at the company despite the closure.
A spokesperson for MainFirst confirmed the closure to Citywire Selector and added: 'Due to the structural demand situation, MainFirst has decided to selectively adjust the product range. The decision to liquidate was taken in view of a reduced fund volume and a challenging market environment.

In a circular to shareholders seen by Citywire Selector, McLemore's company Patient Capital Management said it would be closing the Miller Income Opportunity Trust Ucits fund due to its small size, as it had $24m in assets under management at the end of September.
McLemore founded Patient Capital Management in 2020 and she is now focusing her efforts on growing this venture following the announcement of her mentor Bill Miller's succession plan in January. This plan saw the Miller Opportunity Trust fall under McLemore, while Miller Value Partners would be led by Bill Miller IV.
In the note, Patient Capital Management said: 'With the Ucits fund at its current size, $24m end of Sept, the team felt that it was an unnecessary administrative burden to transfer management and ownership from one firm to another.
'During the last 12 months we've seen several very large redemptions from the Ucits following a couple of idiosyncratic investor events (sold to PE, shift to passive.) as well as general de-risking due to the macro environment, which subsequently caused a cycle of redemptions due to triggering of % holder limits.'
Patient Capital Management added that the fund had primarily appealed to funds of funds and single-family offices, which have a higher tolerance of volatility, as well as beta and duration. However, the general Ucits-buying market has found this less attractive, and this is unlikely to change.
According to Morningstar data sourced by Citywire Selector, the fund's most recent peak in assets was $656m, achieved in May 2021. This fell steadily to $139m one year later, before dropping below $30m from June onwards.
Morningstar performance data for the fund only runs to May 2022.

The Dutch group - owned by Goldman Sachs Asset Management - wrote to investors earlier this month to announce the planned closure of the NN (L) European Participation Equity fund, which was completed on 17 November.
The fund was launched as a Luxembourg-domiciled vehicle in 2017 and had been overseen by the trio of Jeroen de Bruijn, Dimitri van Toren and Stefan Verkroost. The fund's October factsheet indicated it had less than EUR1m in assets at that point.
In its letter to shareholders, NNIP specifically cited the following reasons:
The fund sits 207th out of 257 in the Equity - European Small & Medium Companies sector. It lost 3.2% in euro terms over the three years to October 2022, versus an 8% sector average.
A spokesperson for NNIP confirmed the closure and said it was undertaken to allow the company, and management team, to focus on the NN (L) European Sustainable Small Caps fund, which was launched in June 2022.
'The three portfolio managers manage the NN (L) European Sustainable Small Caps fund. This fund embraces incremental insights from sustainable investing and we feel this product algins with the current market and trends we see,' the spokesperson told Citywire Selector via email.
'Small caps are positioned to profit from sustainable trends in society because they tend to focus on single product which can have a material impact on sustainability.'

2022-11-21,a2402971,Polar Capital suffered a APS3.3bn squeeze on assets,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,John Schaffer,The asset manager's flagship technology fund's assets have dropped to PS3.8bn from PS7bn last year.,"Polar Capital suffered a PS3.3bn squeeze on assets, in what chief executive Gavin Rochussen described as a 'tough six months' for the fund firm.
Assets under management (AUM) dropped 15% from PS22.1bn to PS18.8bn, as more pain was felt in its Global Technology fund.
The AUM fall comprised net outflows of PS800m, redemptions of PS500m related to the collapsed Phaeacian Partners boutique, and a PS2bn decrease due to negative market movements.
The flagship Global Tech fund suffered net outflows of PS569m over six months, adding to already severe client redemptions this year. Assets in technology dropped by PS2.2bn over the six months.
Rochussen (pictured) noted that the higher interest rate environment had prompted investors to pull away from the growth-focused strategy.
He said that the more recent retreat had offset the 'massive' inflows into the tech fund during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that tech sat at a more normalised 37% of the firm's total assets.
The now PS3.8bn Global Technology fund has suffered net outflows of close to PS1.4bn over 12 months, according to Morningstar data, and has also been squeezed by severe negative market moves. A year ago, assets in the fund stood at nearly PS7bn.
The strategy, managed by Nick Evans and Ben Rogoff, has fallen by 26.1% over a year compared with a sector average loss of 27.2%.
Over three years the fund is up 31.1%, slightly ahead of the peer group average return of 29.1%.
UK strategies were also hit in the interim results, with investors pulling PS260m from the UK Value Opportunities fund.
At 8.34am, Polar Capital shares were down 0.4% to 470.5p. Year-to-date, the firm's share price has dropped by 40.4%.
The latest results revealed a pre-tax profit decrease of 27% to PS23m, compared with the same period last year.
That was as a result of lower management fee income, which dropped 14% to PS80m from PS92.9m in the fund firm's interim results last year.
Earnings per share dropped to 17.1p compared with 26.5p at the end of September last year.
Despite the more gloomy picture, the firm retained its interim dividend of 14p, which is to be paid in January.
Rochussen said he was confident about the firm's prospects in 2023, and pointed to growing inflows into its emerging markets and ESG-focused funds.
On a call with Citywire Wealth Manager, he signified his commitment to shareholder payouts and noted that the asset manager had paid an uncovered full-year dividend in 2016/17.",https://citywire.com/wealth-manager/news/polar-capital-assets-drop-3-3bn-on-further-tech-woes/a2402971?re=103196&refea=1751609,6

The Zurich-based manager most recently ran its Global Inflation Linked Bond and Inflation Linked CHF Bond funds. He has held a Citywire rating since the start of 2022 and the top AAA rating since May.
As of 7 November, Philipp Buchler has taken over Koslowski's fund management responsibilities.
He will work alongside the remaining portfolio manager, Brian Buchmann, on the Global Inflation Linked Bond fund. Buchler is a managing director and senior portfolio manager in Credit Suisse AM's global fixed income team and has been with the firm since 2005.

2022-11-23,a2403272,Why Amundi is downgrading EUR45bn worth of Article 9 funds,Drop in ESG score,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,"Industry uncertainty and discrepancies on how to define sustainability make Article 9 reclassifications a matter of responsibility, according to Amundi's chief responsible investment officer.","Amundi will reclassify the majority of its Article 9 funds as Article 8 by the end of this year, affecting approximately 100 products worth EUR45bn, half of which are open-ended funds.
The decision, first reported by Bloomberg, is part of a broader reclassification wave sweeping the European asset management industry ahead of the implementation of level 2 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on 1 January.
Amundi said its 'deliberately cautious approach' was aimed at protecting investors and distributors from a 'significant risk of confusion in the allocation of savings' resulting from the regulatory change.
'While Amundi is pleased to see that regulations have come into force regarding the responsible investment market [...] the current regulatory framework does not yet allow the financial industry to respond in a uniform manner as to what should be considered ""sustainable"" or not,' the firm said.
Elodie Laugel, chief responsible investment officer at Amundi, told Citywire Selector the funds will not change their investment processes as part of the reclassification, and Amundi's 'prudent stance' is aimed at protecting end clients.
She also stressed that the regulatory framework had changed significantly from SFDR level 1 to SFDR level 2.
'For example, all the ETF products that are tracking Paris-alignment were completely compatible with Article 9 in phase 1 of SFDR. In phase 2, very few ETFs answer the requirements of Article 9 because they are built with a transition approach.
'A product with a net-zero objective cannot be classified as Article 9 either, because the companies are in a transition stage.'
Laugel said it was a matter of responsibility to not rush into adapting to the new classification of Article 9, while the regulatory definition of sustainable is not yet stabilised.
She added the discrepancies between different understandings of 'sustainable activities' are too large to make strategic decisions on behalf of end clients' savings.
'As of today, there's a lot of uncertainty and discrepancy within the industry on what should be considered sustainable.
'Therefore we are in a situation where each asset manager has created their own definition, and where the same index of listed companies in developed markets can be considered between 10% to 60% sustainable, depending on your methodology,' said Laugel.
DWS, which recently reclassified five Article 9 funds to Article 8, told Citywire Selector that limiting Article 9 funds' investment universe to sustainable investments calculated on activity level could 'significantly restrict the diversification of a portfolio', and that this had influenced the firm's decision to downgrade.
When asked if Amundi has similar concerns, Laugel said the firm's decision was not related to diversification and rather the protection of end clients, but that questions regarding risk concentration could be raised.
'About 5% of the listed companies in developed markets are aligned with the EU green taxonomy. That means that if you want to reach 100% of green-aligned activities in your portfolio, your investment universe shrinks by 95%.
'Investors need to be aware of potential risk concentration issues. In the end, it's about being transparent with end clients about both the sustainability features and the associated risk profile of Article 9 strategies under SFDR level 2.'
Laugel said the big question would be how to differentiate between the flurry of strategies now occupying the Article 8 bracket, as the swath of reclassifications means some funds have more stringent sustainability criteria than others.",https://citywire.com/selector/news/why-amundi-is-downgrading-45bn-worth-of-article-9-funds/a2403272?utm_medium=website&utm_source=citywire&utm_campaign=article-related-content,1

The change came into effect on 31 October 2022 and concerns the firm's five actively managed strategies according to data from Morningstar:
Combined, the strategies are worth nearly EUR1.97bn as of 18 November 2022.
A DWS spokesperson told Citywire Selector the downgrade reflects the regulatory technical standards on the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) published in July this year, which states funds under Article 9 should only make sustainable investments.
The spokesperson added that DWS determines sustainable investments 'based on an issuer's activity level by means of the turnover share of those activities for the SDG-oriented funds', an approach which was recently confirmed by the regulator.
'This means that only the percentage of sustainable activities weighted by the market value of the relevant security in the portfolio is counted towards the portfolio's share of sustainable investments.
'A limitation to only sustainable investments calculated on activity level for the SDG-oriented funds could significantly restrict the diversification of a portfolio,' the spokesperson told Citywire Selector.
'As a fiduciary of its clients' assets, DWS aims for broad risk diversification. To ensure this, its actively managed Luxembourg-domiciled SDG-oriented Ucits funds will report as Article 8 SFDR going forward.'
DWS SDG-oriented funds invest in companies which provide a positive contribution to at least one of the 17 SDGs.
The DWS Invest SDG Global Equities fund, the largest of the strategies, aims to achieve an aggregate revenue contribution to the sustainable development goals of 50% on average, according to its factsheet.
According to Morningstar Direct, the fund has a sustainability rating of above average, and its corporate sustainability score is lower than the average for the Global Category: Global Equity Large Cap category.
The fund is classified by Morningstar Direct as a low-carbon fund and has a fossil fuel involvement corresponding to 5.83% of its portfolio.
The fund is heavily invested in industrial companies, which account for 28% of the portfolio compared with a 10% allocation in the Morningstar Gbl TME GR USD index.

Tjarnstrom, who announced his departure on LinkedIn, left Celina this month to join the Swedish wealth and fund management company Case Kapitalforvaltning as a portfolio manager.
He spent the majority of his nearly seven years with the firm in business support and middle office, starting in 2015 when Celina Fonder went by the name of Catella Fonder and moving into portfolio management in January 2021.
During his tenure managing the Catella Nordic Corporate Bond Flex fund, which is registered for sale in Luxembourg and Sweden, he managed to stay relatively afloat compared to other funds in the Citywire - Swedish Krona sector.

Fitch had kept a close watch on the fixed income group over the summer of 2020, when it said H2O's 'side-pocketing' plan - which saw the firm hive off illiquid assets off into new portfolios - raised important questions about liquidity levels and the use of complex instruments in daily-dealing funds.
In the wake of the Authorite des Marches Financiers (AMF) recommending a EUR75m charge against H2O, which also involved individual fines for Bruno Crastes and Vincent Chailley, Fitch said it would be an important time to revisit lingering concerns about how liquid funds operate.
In emailed comments to Citywire Selector, Sara Malinowsky, senior analyst at Fitch Ratings, said: 'Volatile markets continue to expose the longstanding liquidity issues of certain daily-dealing funds that invest in illiquid securities and regulatory scrutiny is likely to be heightened given the changing markets.'
When asked directly if asset managers and mutual funds would need to look more closely at their liquidity and exposure to less-liquid markets, Malinowsky said: 'This potential fine and ban revives the debate of daily-dealing funds invested in illiquid asset classes, and may act as a warning signal to asset managers to review their risk management and investment decision processes.'
H2O AM has pushed back against the AMF's recommended fine, which also includes a 10-year investment ban for Crastes.
The company, which has relocated its headquarters to Paris since the 2019 liquidity issues were first raised, said it would accept it had exceeded certain investment ratios but denied it had breached investment rules around exposure to Tennor Group and the buy and selling back of such securities.

Bluebell Capital Partners wrote last month to Fink to call for the role of chair and chief executive to be split and for a new chief exec to be appointed, to replace longtime board member Murry Gerber and perform a 'strategic review' of BlackRock's ESG stance and its new proxy voting programme, BlackRock Voting Choice.
The Bluebell letter, dated 10 November and obtained by Citywire on Wednesday, claims that BlackRock's stance on ESG has led to the current backlash it is facing from Republican lawmakers as well as criticism from climate activists, and that Fink has handled the situation badly.
'The contradictions and apparent hypocrisy of BlackRock's actions have unnecessarily politicised the ESG debate, leading to the only possible outcome of mobilising the protests of a plurality of BlackRock's customers who have very different views on ESG-related risks,' Bluebell wrote, adding to Fink that the group 'find[s] your response to the widespread criticism quite amateurish.'
'We are not reluctant to state that, in our capacity as investment manager, we view BlackRock's shareholdings as an ESG risk factor in the companies in which we invest, and when possible, we prefer to invest in companies where BlackRock is not a significant shareholder,' the Bluebell letter continued. It called the expansion of BlackRock's proxy voting choice programme a 'capitulation of its obligation to exercise its fiduciary duties and little more than a cute commercial tool.'
BlackRock has noted repeatedly that critics with ESG concerns (including the states of Florida, Texas, Missouri, Louisiana and West Virginia, which have taken steps to divest from the firm) have not raised issues with the firm's performance. It has also highlighted that it is still a significant investor in fossil fuels.
This latter point, however, means the firm has also drawn ire from progressive politicians and climate activists, with its New York headquarters recently the target of protesters.
Bluebell, which has about $250m in assets under management, owns very little of BlackRock with about 12,000 shares, or roughly $80,000 at the current share price of $712. BlackRock's market value is about $106bn, indicating that Bluebell's stake is a minute fraction of the firm's ownership.
'In the past 18 months, Bluebell has waged a number of campaigns to promote their climate and governance agenda,' a BlackRock spokesperson said. 'BlackRock Investment Stewardship did not support their campaigns as we did not consider them to be in the best economic interests of our clients.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/activist-calls-for-blackrock-boss-to-go-over-esg-hypocrisy/a2404429,6

Prior to joining Pictet, she spent 12 years at Wellington Management.
Morgan (pictured above) was appointed head of fixed income in October. He joined the firm from BlackRock in 2019 as investment director, multi-asset and was promoted to the role of investment director for Jupiter's fixed income and multi-asset platform in 2021.

A Storebrand AM spokesperson told Citywire Selector the firm's Plus range was reclassified to Article 8 on 5 December.
This range includes the EUR1.1bn Storebrand Global ESG Plus fund , which is registered for sale in Luxembourg, the UK and the Netherlands via its sub-fund.
The change covers five other Sweden-domiciled strategies:
The SEK 8.8bn (EUR798m) Storebrand Sverige Plus fund;
the SEK 29.6bn Storebrand Global Plus fund;
the SEK 971m Storebrand Europa Plus fund;
the SEK 4.9bn Storebrand USA Plus fund;
and the SEK 1.1bn Storebrand Sverige Smabolag Plus fund.
The Storebrand Global ESG Plus fund is a fossil fuel-free global equity fund that invests in low-carbon companies with a high sustainability rating.
The fund invests up to 10% of its assets in companies adapted to UN sustainability goals of clean energy, energy efficiency, recycling and low-carbon transport.
It has 661 holdings as of its latest factsheet from November and has a Storebrand sustainability score of eight out of 10.
The spokesperson said the Plus range's investment process, which aims to lower the carbon footprint of its holdings over time, would remain unchanged.
'This is purely a change of interpretation based on what we perceive is a new praxis in the EU's fund industry, and which has intensified over the past month,' they said, referring to the large number of Article 9 downgrades made by firms such as BlackRock and Amundi.
As it remains uncertain whether the aim of a reduced carbon footprint will be included in the much-debated, 100% sustainable investments criteria for Article 9 strategies, the spokesperson said Storebrand had chosen to reclassify as a cautionary measure.
'We believe that this praxis is the most guidance clients have as of today, and to contribute to standardisation and transparency this feels reasonable for now.
'The question of how this regulatory framework will be interpreted is a continuous challenge for the entire industry and we are humble in the face of its complexity.
'We will adapt our classification as we receive more information and clarity from the EU, either remaining as Article 8 funds or back to Article 9.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/storebrand-am-downgrades-nearly-7bn-worth-of-article-9-funds/a2404710,2

Arizona divested more than $543m (EUR510m) in BlackRock money market funds earlier this year and plans to continue phasing out exposure because the firm has 'moved from a traditional asset manager to a political action committee,' Arizona state treasurer Kimberly Yee said.
Yee, who was re-elected last month, cited questions and concerns over BlackRock's embrace of ESG, which have prompted other red states including Texas, Florida, Missouri, West Virginia and Louisiana to take state money elsewhere.
In contrast to other divesting states, though, Yee said Arizona's investment management team would continue to hold small stakes in BlackRock funds to act as an activist by voting its shares.
'We will continue to fight back against the dangerous path of companies pushing their social issues and ""wokeism"" inside of the investment space and return to traditional money management that puts the people first,' Yee said in a statement.
Separately, North Carolina treasurer Dale Folwell has publicly called on Fink to resign, claiming that he [Fink] and BlackRock have 'been using the financial power of their clients to force the global warming agenda' instead of focusing purely on returns.
Folwell said North Carolina had about $14bn invested in BlackRock's funds as well as $55m in BlackRock stocks and bonds but did not mention any plan to divest from the $8tn asset manager. He said he had signed a deal with BlackRock to allow the North Carolina Retirement Systems to vote its shares through BlackRock's proxy voting program, dubbed Voting Choice.
'A focus on ESG is not a focus on returns, and potentially could force us to violate our own fiduciary duty of loyalty,' Folwell said in a statement.
Folwell's comments come after a small activist investor, Bluebell Capital Partners, called on Fink to resign for doing too little in the way of ESG advocacy.
The remarks from Folwell and Yee are the latest in a growing campaign against BlackRock, led by Republican lawmakers. While it has resulted in BlackRock losing a fraction of its massive asset base, it has generated a wave of negative headlines for the firm, which now faces increased questions from investors about its approach to ESG.
In response to the campaign, BlackRock has tried to emphasise that it is not divested from fossil fuels (as the world's largest index investor, the firm is one of the largest shareholders in many major legacy energy companies) and that aims to offer investors as broad a range of choices as possible. It has also said that by considering the risks posed by climate change, it is adhering to its fiduciary duty, but acting in clients' best interests.
It has previously stated: 'BlackRock's belief that climate risk poses investment risk is backed by our publicly-available research. We also understand, however, that these views are not universal. For this reason, we offer clients a broad choice of investment products... that allow clients to gain broad market exposure, including to energy companies, and to make energy-specific investments.'
It is a message it repeated in its most recent statement, in response to the notes from officials in Arizona and North Carolina.
'Over the past year, BlackRock has been subject to campaigns suggesting we are either ""too progressive"" or ""too conservative"" in how we manage our clients' money. We are neither. We are a fiduciary,' a BlackRock spokesman said in a statement. 'We put our clients' interests first and deliver the investment choices and performance they need. We will not let these campaigns sway us from delivering for our clients.'

BNY Mellon said Hutchins had worked closely with its Diversity Project and other investment firms on best practices to help address the impact that the loss of performance continuity through a leave of absence can have on an investment career.
Hutchins had been Citywire + rated for her risk-adjusted performance within the mixed-asset peer group. She had co-run the strategy with Aron Pataki and Andrew Warwick, who remain on the fund.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/newton-im-fund-manager-suzanne-hutchins-dies/a2405258,3
2022-12-19,a2405213,Woodford lawsuit has first hearing in High Court,Negative press,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jeremy Gordon,A legal claim against Link Fund Solutions on behalf of investors who lost money in Neil Woodford's collapsed Equity Income fund begins court proceedings this week.,"A major legal claim on behalf of investors who lost money in Neil Woodford's collapsed Equity Income fund is beginning court proceedings today.
A hearing in the High Court in London on 19 and 20 December will be used to consider an application on behalf of clients of law firms Leigh Day and Harcus Parker against Link Fund Solutions, asking the court to set terms for the case's management.
Investors are suing Link, rather than Woodford himself, as the authorised corporate director with ultimate responsibility for overseeing and managing the fund.
The fund suspended trading in June 2019 after the portfolio became overly concentrated in unlisted and hard-to-trade stocks at the same time as outflows mounted. While there have been five distributions so far as Link has wound up the fund, trapped investors have yet to get all their capital back and have been told they may have to wait until the middle of next year.
'This hearing is an important step forward in the claims being made on behalf of investors in the Woodford Equity Income Fund,' said Meriel Hodgson-Teall, senior associate at Leigh Day.
'Thousands of investors in this fund have suffered life-changing financial losses, which they allege is a result of Link Fund Solutions' failings in managing the fund.'
Key points to be addressed in today and tomorrow's hearing include asking the court:
That claims against Link can be managed together as a single 'group litigation order'.
That Leigh Day and Harcus Parker (which joined forces in June) can be jointly appointed as lead solicitors.
To set deadlines for parties to file their pleadings.
To set a deadline for investors to join the group claim and establish a register of claimants.
Link Fund Solutions is opposing the case-management proposals, according to Leigh Day. Link declined to comment.
The firm has consistently denied liability to investors and Australian parent Link Group has raised the possibility it could allow the UK subsidiary to collapse rather than picking up the bill for any fines and compensation.
Leigh Day said it was possible the judge would set out their decisions at the end of today and tomorrow's hearing, although these could be delayed until the new year.
The judgement will not decide the outcome of the claims, which if continuing to trial could take years for a final resolution.
Leigh Day currently represents more than 13,000 investors in the fund, with claims on behalf of those clients estimated to be worth in excess of PS100m.
The Financial Conduct Authority has said it may seek as much as PS306m in redress from Link Fund Solutions for failings in managing the Woodford fund's liquidity, as well as proposing a PS50m fine. Discussions on the fine were extended in early October and are ongoing. It is unclear how compensation set by the City regulator and in legal claims might affect each other.
A separate lawsuit led by RGL Management is also targeting Hargreaves Lansdown for its role in promoting the fund, in addition to Link.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/woodford-lawsuit-has-first-hearing-in-high-court/a2405213,5
2023-01-03,a2405641,Pimco Total Return under review as Mather exits,Portfolio manager change,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Will Schmitt,"Scott Mather had been on a leave of absence since October, but has now retired from the bond house.","Pimco portfolio manager Scott Mather has retired from the firm two months after he abruptly took a personal leave of absence.
Mather's departure from the bond house based in California's Newport Beach, where he had worked since 1998, was reported earlier this week by Morningstar, which has subsequently placed his various funds under review.
In early October, Mather took indefinite leave and as a result was removed from a number of funds he ran, including the $56bn (PS47bn) Pimco Total Return
fund.
As a result of his subsequent retirement, the personnel changes initially made to his funds will remain in place. These included group chief investment officer Dan Ivascyn, who also manages the $114bn Pimco Income
fund, and Qi Wang, the firm's CIO of portfolio implementation, joining the Total Return fund alongside Mohit Mittal and Mark Kiesel.
Mather was also removed from the $6.9bn Pimco Low Duration , $351m Pimco Low Duration II
and $408m Pimco Low Duration ESG
funds, as well as the $1.2bn C and $1.2bn M series of the Pimco Fixed Income SHares
(FISH) portfolios.
Marc Seidner, CIO for non-traditional strategies, Daniel Hyman and Jelle Brons have been added to the Low Duration fund, alongside Jerome Schneider.
Schneider will continue to manage the Low Duration II fund, with Seidner and Mike Cudzil added to that strategy. Brons and Schneider remain on the ESG-related strategy, where they have been joined by Seidner. Cudzil and Vinayak Seshasayee have joined David Braun on the FISH portfolios.
As a result of these changes being made permanent by Mather's retirement, Morningstar has placed all of the funds under review.
The Total Return fund was previously rated gold by Morningstar analysts for its cheapest share class, with more expensive share classes rated silver or bronze.
Mather and Kiesel took on the Total Return fund in 2014 after the sudden and acrimonious departure of Bill Gross from Pimco.
When Mather's leave of absence was first disclosed, Morningstar strategist Eric Jacobson maintained his gold analyst rating for Total Return, despite the management changes.
'We are reassured that Pimco has added a mix of senior portfolio managers to support these strategies while Mather is away, and we do not view the news as a source of concern for now,' he wrote at the time.
'Longer term, we will be monitoring the additional workload this brings to existing portfolio managers, as well as the timeline for Mather's return to portfolio management duties, but we are not making any changes to our Morningstar analyst ratings for any of the affected strategies.'
Following news of Mather's retirement, Jacobson wrote: 'Given that Mather's departure is now permanent, we are placing these strategies under review and will be assessing whether to make any changes to their analyst ratings.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/pimco-total-return-under-review-as-mather-exits/a2405641,10
2023-01-04,a2405717,Ex-Alken PMs' boutique closes flagship fund after investors withdraw,Liquidation of a fund,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,"New venture focused on European equities forced to shutter main strategy due to prevailing market conditions, Citywire Selector has learned.","The boutique formed by a group of former Alken employees has closed its flagship fund after the European equity strategy was deemed no longer economically viable, Citywire Selector has learned.
Adelio Partners was formed in mid-2020 by Antoine Badel, Gilles Stuttgen, Vincent Rech and Salim Alaoui, all of whom had worked under Nicolas Walewski at Alken as either fund managers or analysts or in trading. Former Kairos employee Ash Brown served as chief operating officer of Adelio.
The quintet established the company with the intention of offering a Ucits-compliant strategy that would focus on fundamental stock picking with an emphasis on the ESG credentials of potential investments. The strategy was launched in mid-2021.
However, in a note to shareholders on 20 December, Adelio said it had decided to close the Adelio European fund, with all proceeds to be returned to investors on or about 31 January 2023.
'In passing the resolution, the board concluded that the sub-fund is no longer economically viable and that it is in the best interests of shareholders to liquidate the sub-fund in light of the prevailing market conditions,' the note read.
The fund's November factsheet indicated that it had EUR21m in assets under management. This is understood to have been largely drawn from a pool of investors based mainly in Switzerland. It was the decision of one of the main investors in this pool to redeem their investment that led to the fund being wound up.
In March 2022, Adelio worked with Swiss group Bonhote Fund Solutions to accelerate capital raising for its flagship fund. This was with the intention of increasing assets under management to around EUR50m.
A person familiar with the matter said the fund had reached EUR30m at its peak but investor appetite had not been as strong as anticipated. It was thought the timing of the launch, which occurred during the pandemic and was followed by the war in Ukraine, meant it was unlikely to prove attractive in the near term.
It is understood the management team of Adelio Partners remains in place, with the intention of launching a new strategy once seed investors can be found. The vehicle is unlikely to follow a similar investment path as the Adelio European fund.
The Adelio European fund had been a concentrated portfolio of 37 stocks primarily invested in financials, which made up almost a quarter of overarching investments, while industrials was just under one-fifth of its allocation. Stocks listed in the French market meant the fund had around 43% invested in companies operating in that market.
The Adelio European Fund sits 563 out of 693 active funds in the Equity - Europe Blend sector over the 12 months to the end of November 2022. It returned -13.7% over that timeframe, which compares with the average sector return of -7.5%.",https://citywireselector.com/news/ex-alken-pms-boutique-closes-flagship-fund-after-investors-withdraw/a2405717,6

According to a Swedbank Robur spokesperson, Bao stepped off the SEK 6.2bn (EUR556m) Swedbank Robur Selection 25 , the SEK 9.2bn Swedbank Robur Selection 50 , and the SEK 6.7bn Swedbank Robur Selection 75
funds when she took parental leave in late 2020.
The mixed-asset strategies, which invest in other funds as well as placing direct investments, will continue to be managed by Malin Hallen and Johan Alm.

the SEK 26.2bn Swedbank Robur Bas 25 ;
the SEK 38.4bn Swedbank Robur Bas 50 ;
the SEK 19.3bn Swedbank Robur Bas 75 ;
and the SEK 9.9bn Swedbank Robur Bas 100 .
She co-runs the funds with Jorgen Olofsson and Mats Lilja.
The Bas funds mainly invest in other actively managed Swedbank Robur funds. The Swedbank Robur Bas 100 fund is the only one of the four to have outperformed its Citywire sector average over the three-year period ending November 2022. It returned 12% compared with the Citywire - Global Blend sector average of 10.5%.",https://citywireselector.com/news/swedbank-robur-pm-moves-to-8-25bn-team/a2405718,12

fund, Citywire has learned.
In an update posted on its site at the end of last year, Fidelity said the decision to stop private investors adding to the PS1.2bn fund from 30 December had been taken in the 'best interest' of customers. However, it did not explain the underlying rationale.
The strategy, whose long-term record under manager Richard Watts was scuppered by a reversal of market conditions last year, has faced heavy outflows and remains in the process of selling a significant unlisted stake in digital bank Starling.
'We believe this decision is in the best interest of our clients. Customers are able to redeem existing holdings in this fund. However, [they] can no longer buy shares until further notice,' a Fidelity International spokesperson told Citywire.
Private investors on the platform, which carried PS31.2bn of assets at the midpoint of 2022, will still be able to sell or switch their position.
The change does not affect financial advisers or discretionary fund managers (DFMs) using Fidelity Adviser Solutions, although execution-only customers on the platform will be restricted from new buys of the fund.
The fund was the eighth strategy to face restrictions on new investment on the Fidelity platform in 2022. The most recent run of suspensions related to fund charges, notably hitting strategies that invest heavily in investment trusts.
Jupiter's Fund of Investment Trusts
and Premier Miton Worldwide Opportunities
(another portfolio made up of London-listed closed-end funds) have been restricted to new investment since last summer.
Sources said that changes to the way open-ended funds disclose charges when they hold investment trusts had pushed the charges of the funds above 2.5% - an unofficial threshold after which the platform will stop new investments.
The L share class of Jupiter UK Mid Cap, which appears to be the most expensive on the Fidelity platform, has a 1.6% annual charge, according to the latest factsheet.
A larger number of funds with exposure to Russian assets were suspended from trading entirely following the invasion of Ukraine last February, trapping investors' money.
Concerns about liquidity in the underlying portfolio have also seen daily-dealing funds face trading restrictions or suspensions in the past.
Starling sale ongoing
The step by Fidelity continues a difficult period for Jupiter UK Mid Cap, which endured heavy outflows last year after racking up large losses.
Watts' portfolio also faced growing investor scrutiny over its exposure to unquoted stocks - chiefly Starling - which at times neared the 10% regulatory limit.
Investors pulled more than PS1bn from the fund in 2022, while the portfolio was down 40%, according to Morningstar.
That saw the fund sink to PS1.2bn of assets at the end of November, a third of its peak in August 2021.
In the 10 years to the end of November, Jupiter UK Mid Cap returned 79%, below the 99% gain for the FTSE 250 ex-Investment Trust Index and putting it in the third quartile of peers.
Watts also co-manages the equally embattled Chrysalis (CHRY ) investment trust, another backer of Starling, which saw its shares slide to a gaping discount after a performance fee furore.
Starling had fallen to a 5.2% weighting in Jupiter UK Mid Cap at the end of November, according to the latest factsheet. Holiday company Secret Escapes is also a much smaller unquoted position.
Jupiter's open-ended funds have been trying to sell their stakes in the challenger bank since August. In late September, the group was widely reported to be within weeks of a sale to other existing investors. However, as market conditions have remained volatile, the hunt for a buyer remains ongoing.
Jupiter said it would not comment directly on the Fidelity decision, or on the Starling sale.
In a statement sent to Citywire Wealth Manager, the firm said it continued to employ a 'prudent' approach to its unlisted exposure.
'In line with our active management philosophy, we regularly review the performance of our investment holdings and look for new attractive opportunities to recycle capital in the interests of our clients, and we prudently manage our unlisted exposures as part of this process,' the statement read.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/fidelity-suspends-investment-in-jupiter-uk-mid-cap-fund/a2405820,5

These include the Global Emerging Markets Bond
fund, which will shut on 27 January.
Managed by Asad Bhatti and Stuart Edwards, the PS19.3m fund has lost 13.3% over three years. That compares with an 8.7% loss for the IA Global Emerging Market Bond - Blended sector.
Net outflows have amounted to PS3.7m over the same period, according to Morningstar data, leaving the fund in an untenable position.
'Invesco reviews its fund range on a regular basis and it has been decided that the fund is no longer economically viable and will therefore be closed on the 27 January 2023,' the firm said in a statement.
Citywire + rated Edwards runs several other fixed income mandates for the fund house, including the Global Income , Global Bond UK , Tactical Bond UK

funds.
However, another of Edwards' funds, the Global Unconstrained Bond fund, has also been closed. It had PS6.6m in assets on 12 October.
Raft of closures
Invesco has liquidated several other European-domiciled funds alongside the Global Emerging Markets Bond fund. Each had less than EUR15m (PS13.3m) in assets.
This includes the Invesco Euro High Yield Bond fund, which had been managed by Citywire + rated duo Stuart Stanley and Niklas Nordenfelt. The fund held EUR12.4m, having originally been launched as a Luxembourg-domiciled vehicle in mid-2017.
There were two closures related to sustainability-focused emerging market funds. This includes the Invesco Responsible Emerging Markets Innovators Equity fund, launched in August 2019 and with $6.1m in assets. It had been run by Justin Leverenz, who runs several other emerging market funds.
The final fund to close was the Invesco Sustainable Emerging Markets Structured Equity fund, which had been under the stewardship of Alexander Uhlmann and Alexander Tavernaro. It had just $7.2m in assets when the decision was made to close the fund.

Randy Robertson, 62, was previously the co-manager of the BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust (BIT), a closed-ended fund that, between 2015 and 2019, invested as much as $75m in film distribution company Aviron Group and its subsidiaries.
According to the SEC complaint, Robertson played a 'significant role' in recommending the fund's loans to Aviron, which by July 2017 was the largest single investment in its portfolio at about 10% of assets. But he failed to disclose that he had asked the company's founder and principal William Sadleir to help out with his daughter's acting career.
According to the SEC, an unnamed potential investment source, to whom Robertson had emailed his daughter's resume and photos, introduced Robertson to Sadleir in 2014. Robertson then took his daughter to multiple meetings with Sadleir, one of which also was attended by an unnamed BlackRock colleague.
Aviron indeed got her a small role in a film called After in 2018 and had mentioned the possibility of additional roles and meetings with agents, but in 2019 the situation unravelled in spectacular fashion. At the end of that year, BlackRock had written down the investment in Aviron to zero, sued Sadleir for fraud, and was investigating Robertson over his conflict of interest.
The fallout was first reported by The Wall Street Journal's Jason Zweig in his Intelligent Investor column in the paper in February 2020. Sadleir initially denied committing fraud when asked by the WSJ. He later pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and in September 2022 was sentenced to six years in prison for defrauding BIT out of $30m, which he used to buy a $14m Beverly Hills mansion and for other personal expenses.
Robertson was fired by BlackRock in February 2020.
'Investment professionals must be forthcoming about any conflicts of interest they may have with the companies in which they invest client funds, including situations involving favours or assistance to family members,' said Andrew Dean, co-chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit, in a statement.
'Investors must be able to know that the advice they receive is free of undisclosed conflicts, regardless of whether the conflict is financial in nature.'

The Global Income fund lost 12.4% over the period versus a Mixed Asset - Balanced USD sector average gain of 4.4%. The Asian Bond fund fared better but remained negative, with a 12.1% loss in US dollar terms against a Bond - Asia Pacific Local Currency sector average loss of 15%.
On the Global Income fund, Ho will be added to the fixed income sleeve and work alongside Michael Hasenstab, who is chief investment officer for Templeton Global Macro, as well as Derek Taner and Douglas Grant, who run the equity aspect of the fund.
Ho will also work with Hasenstab on the Asian Bond fund, where Vivek Ahuja is also a named manager. Both Hasenstab and Ahuja are also named on the EM Dynamic Income fund, where Ho will work with them on bond allocations, while Chetan Sehgal and Subash Pillai will run the equity side.

According to Morningstar Direct, the reclassification has been applied to strategies including:
The EUR244.7m LBPAM Responsable Actions Euro fund
The EUR448m LBPAM ISR Pro Actions Euro fund
The EUR13m LBPAM SRI Human Rights fund
The EUR198.5m LBPAM ISR Actions Europe Monde fund
LBPAM did not respond to Citywire Selector's questions regarding which other four funds have been affected by the change.
In a press statement published on the firm's website late last year, LBPAM said the decision to reclassify strategies was due to the current regulatory grey areas when it comes to the definition of sustainable investments.
The Paris-based group wrote: 'The Level 1 SFDR definition currently offers significant leeway in the interpretation of sustainable investments, potentially giving rise to varying levels of requirements and thus to major disparities in sustainability scores assigned for similar financial products.'
The press statement continued: 'European supervisors made it a point to address this concern, calling on the European Commission in September 2022 to provide greater clarifications.
'Pending these clarifications, we made the decision to reclassify some of our Article 9 funds as Article 8 funds. We preferred taking this conservative approach rather than lowering the requirement level for the definition of sustainable investments, which would have allowed us to comply with SFDR Level 2 for Article 9 products, but we considered contrary to our commitments.'
The firm added that the reclassification will have no impact on the 'non-financial strategy and ambition' of the funds. 'Our ambition is to help our clients achieve the sustainable and civic transition of the economy and thus refuse to level-down our non-financial requirements,' said LBP AM in the press statement",https://citywireselector.com/news/la-banque-postale-am-downgrades-half-of-its-article-9-fund-range/a2406392,4

Lapeyre (pictured) was most recently with Amundi, where he worked since 2010 covering mixed-asset and global equity portfolios. He formally joined Paris-based Amplegest on 12 January.
In a statement announcing the hire, Amplegest said the team under Lapeyre will be completed in the coming months, which is understood to involve the addition of another fund manager.

Bastin has spent more than two decades in corporate credit, which includes stints with Deutsche Bank, Schroders Investment Management and Commerzbank.
The addition of Bastin marks the latest expansion of Man GLG's credit platform, which has included the appointment of portfolio managers such as Michael Scott and Jonathan Golan in recent years.
The wider bond unit capacity was also expanded earlier this month with the appointment of Jason Late, who joined from Ares Asset Management to cover European CLOs and leveraged loans.
'We are extremely proud of the expansion of our credit platform in recent years and Christina's appointment is a fantastic and welcome addition,' said Teun Johnston, CEO of Man GLG.
'We're seeing an increase in interest from clients in our credit offering and Christina's approach - combining deep local knowledge with expertise on the macro, regulatory and policy side - will help us address that demand.'

fund (MCRDX) on 15 March.
Both of these funds also exist as Ucits-compliant vehicles, which were launched in 2014 and 2015, respectively.
It had understood the liquidation would extend to these strategies. However, a spokesperson told Citywire Selector: 'No decision has been made to date regarding the Ucits funds.'
These have $67m (Total Return Bond) and $29m (Credit Opportunities) in assets, according to most recently available company data.
'After a decade of trying to establish and grow these funds, shareholder interest and demand for Asia bond strategies has not developed and reached scale as we had anticipated. At the same time, we do remain committed to exploring solutions for clients across the emerging markets,' said CEO Cooper Abbott.

Both funds are managed by lead portfolio manager Satya Patel and Wei Zhang. Teresa Kong, who had been the lead manager on both funds since their inception in 2011 and 2016, respectively, left the firm in August 2022, according to her LinkedIn profile.
It was not revealed whether Patel, who is listed as head of fixed income on his LinkedIn, and Zhang, who joined in 2015, will stay with the group as a result of the closure.
The US-domiciled version of the Matthews Asia Total Return Bond fund was launched in November 2011 and since then has attracted net inflows of $47.5m.
Its assets under management peaked at $116.8m in 2019, but it suffered net outflows of $51.3m in 2022, a brutal year for bonds and China, which also saw the departure of the fund's lead manager Kong.
After the bond funds are liquidated, Matthews will offer 21 funds, all of which invest in equities.

2023-01-20,a2407187,Jupiter merges two more funds as cull continues,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,Citywire,Nicola Blackburn,Jupiter Asian and Jupiter North American Income funds are latest casualties of Jupiter's consolidation project.,"Jupiter Fund Management (JUP) is proposing the closure of its North American Income fund
and its Jupiter Asian fund , as it continues to cull a third of its 100-strong fund range.
In a letter to investors circulated last week, Jupiter said it intended to merge the PS110.6m Jupiter North American Income fund into its existing PS1.4bn Jupiter Merian North American Equity fund .
In the letter, Jupiter said the merger made sense following its acquisition of Merian Global Investors in 2020, which saw Jupiter resume management of several Merian funds with similar investment processes.
'We believe that the [fund] merger...provides continuity of investment process given the same investment team manages the merging fund and the receiving fund... and sees a decrease of 45bps per annum in the fees currently paid by investors [in the merging fund],' it said.
The funds have different investment objectives. The original North American Income fund aims to provide income together with capital growth over at least five years, but the new fund seeks capital growth over rolling three-year periods.
The receiving fund has significantly outperformed the merging fund on a three-year basis, though it only marginally outperformed the merging fund in 2022. Managed by Amadeo Alentorn, the Jupiter Merian North American Equity fund has returned -7.2% and 34.9% over one and three years respectively.
In a separate notice to shareholders last week, Jupiter also announced it intended to merge its PS42.7m Asian fund into its existing PS1.2bn Jupiter Asian Income fund.
Jupiter said the merger followed a 'comprehensive review' of its entire fund range, that would result in the merging of funds with similar investment objectives.
Both funds share the same investment objective, to achieve a return higher than their target benchmarks over at least five years, though the receiving fund also aims to generate income of at least 20% higher than its target benchmark, the FTSE Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index.
Subject to shareholder approval at meetings in February, both mergers will take place on 10 March.
The two funds are the latest in a series of Jupiter strategies to be culled, after it was reported that the asset manager would merge or close a third of its 100-strong fund range. Jupiter has merged or closed 17 funds since September, with that figure including some share classes of existing funds.
Senior departures
The culls also come amid a series of recent high-profile departures from Jupiter's investment management and senior management teams.
Jupiter veteran Edward Bonham Carter left the firm at the end of last year, following 28 years at the asset manager, a term which included stints as chief executive and vice-chair. Bonham Carter's departure came six months after Andrew Formica, former chief exec of Jupiter, left the asset manager in June. Formica was replaced by Matthew Beesley.
Jupiter will cut 80 staff under its new chief executive, a measure which saw the departure of Jupiter's former head of multi-asset, Talib Sheikh, in December.
Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings recently downgraded its outlook on Jupiter (JUP) from 'stable' to 'negative'.
Jupiter's share price fell 41% in the 12 months to 19 January.

2023-02-01,a2408044,Nick Train lifts his 'skin' in Finsbury Growth with PS1m of share purchases,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jamie Colvin,Flurry of share deals sees fund manager raise his stake in Finsbury Growth & Income to 2.3%.,"Finsbury Growth & Income (FGT ) portfolio manager Nick Train has bought more than PS1m worth of shares in the UK equity income trust in the past three months, signalling his belief that the portfolio of quality growth stocks is undervalued by the market.
Three purchases starting on 3 November culminated last week with Train buying 52,227 shares at 861p, lifting his personal holding to 2.3%, or more than 4.8 million shares, in the PS1.8bn trust.
That transaction cost the manager over PS449,000 and followed the PS214,000 purchase of 25,000 shares on 4 January and the PS406,000 acquisition of the first tranche of 50,000 shares in November.
The share deals come as the former top performer, a stable mate of Train's Linsdell Train UK Equity
open-ended fund, continues to trade at a discount after two years of poor returns.
At their current price of 873p, Finsbury Growth shares stand nearly 5% below their net asset value, in contrast with the small premium at which they habitually traded in previous years.
At today's price, the manager's stake is worth PS42.4m, making him the sixth-largest shareholder behind wealth managers Evelyn Partners, Rathbones and Investec, according to Refinitiv data.
Train, who shared PS39m of dividends with his business partner Michael Lindsell last year, has been a consistent buyer of Finsbury Growth, which he has managed since 2000.
The trust's annual reports show that at the end of September 2022 he owned 4.6 million shares, worth PS30.8m at the time. Twelve months before that he held 3.6 million shares worth PS32m, up from 3.1 million shares in 2020 worth PS26m, and 2.6 million shares worth PS25m in 2019.
At the trust's annual general meeting last month, Train (pictured above) stressed the importance of 'having skin in the game' by aligning his interests with those of other shareholders, particularly while the trust is underperforming rivals and the UK stock market.
He is not alone in this. Research by Investec analysts in 2021 highlighted big stakes by other investment trust managers, notably Chris Mills, who owned PS167m of North Atlantic Smaller Companies (NAS ), and Alex Darwall, who at the time held a PS28m stake in European Opportunities (EOT ).
In the past three years, Finsbury Growth shareholders have seen a total return of just 4.6% as Train's buy-and-hold strategy with global consumer brands struggled at a time when technology and cheap-at-the-time 'value' stocks led markets. The performance has lagged the FTSE All Share's 15.6% gain and the average 15.1% return from UK equity income trusts. Over 10 years, however, a 157% return puts the trust near the top of its peer group and well ahead of the All-Share index, which rose 85%.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/nick-train-lifts-his-skin-in-finsbury-growth-with-1m-of-share-purchases/a2408044,6
2023-02-01,a2408146,Matthews Asia axes Ucits funds as part of bond fund cull,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,San Francisco-based group had previously terminated US-domiciled strategies and the cull now extends to Luxembourg vehicles.,"Matthews Asia's decision to curtail its bond fund offering has now extended to those sitting within its Ucits-compliant range, Citywire Selector has learned.
Citywire announced last month that the San Francisco-based asset manager was liquidating its two fixed-income products due to lack of interest. The $61.3m Matthews Asia Total Return Bond
and the $27m Matthews Asia Credit Opportunities
funds are due to be wound up by 15 March.
At the time, Citywire Selector reported that the cull would extend to the funds' respective Ucits equivalents. However, a spokesperson for Matthews Asia said no decision had been made on the Luxembourg-domiciled versions.
According to letters sent to shareholders on 31 January, the decision has now been made to follow suit and close down the $67m Ucits-compliant Total Return Bond and $29m Credit Opportunities funds on 10 February.
Notes for the separate funds followed the same wording: 'It is the view of the board of directors that the sub-fund has not benefited from a satisfactory level of market reception by potential investors and there are limited prospects of attracting new investments in the sub-fund in the near future.'
Satya Patel and Wei Zhang, who co-ran the US- and Luxembourg-domiciled versions of the funds, will stay with Matthews Asia despite the closures.
In terms of performance, the Matthews Asia Total Return Bond fund lost 12.3% in US dollar terms over the three years to the end of December 2022, while the average performance in the Bonds - Asia Pacific Local Currency sector over the same period was a drop of 13.2%.
Meanwhile, the Matthews Asia Credit Opportunities fund dropped 16.9% over the same period. The average performance in the Bonds - Asia Pacific Hard Currency sector over the same period was only marginally better - a drop of 16.3%.",https://citywireselector.com/news/matthews-asia-axes-ucits-funds-as-part-of-bond-fund-cull/a2408146,5
2023-02-01,a2408144,Chrysalis can't escape 2022 horror show as it looks to sell stragglers,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Gavin Lumsden,"Release of first quarter and annual results knocks 10% off shares in Jupiter's growth capital fund, showing a 46% slump in asset value last year with prospect of more pain to come.","Chrysalis Investments (CHRY ) is looking to sell up to 19% of its portfolio in loss-making companies, adding to investors' fears that further write-downs on its investments could delay the Jupiter growth capital fund's recovery from a traumatic 2022.
A first-quarter update today revealed the late-stage private equity fund's net asset value (NAV) fell 13.2% in the last three months of last year, taking its total loss for 2022 to 46%. The bigger-than-expected decline sent the shares falling 10% to 78p (although they recovered on Thursday to reach 86p).
Last year's NAV slump was largely caused by the huge write-down of credit provider Klarna at its $800m fund-raising in April, and also by declines in previously unquoted companies whose shares fell in the bear market after flotation.
All of this led to a massive de-rating in the shares, which plunged 69% in 2022 as investors feared more losses would come as the bubble in disruptive 'unicorn' growth stocks unwound.
Some investors also dumped the stock in disgust at the PS112m performance fee Jupiter and managers Richard Watts, who also runs the Jupiter UK Mid Cap
fund, and Nick Williamson extracted at the top of the market in 2021, although the company is revising the fee so that can't happen again.
Chrysalis today didn't specify which of its 13 holdings were responsible for most of the latest 19.53p drop in NAV per share to 128.26p at 31 December, but Stifel analyst Iain Scouller said comparison with annual results to September published just yesterday showed steep declines in four of the portfolio's holdings.
The write-downs are the result of the fund's new independent valuation committee taking a more market-based approach to valuing investments, as opposed to mainly looking at the price investors had paid in their most recent fund-raisings.
Scouller said insurer Wefox and Starling bank, whose commercial progress has been strong, both fell about 18%; Graphcore, the British semi-conductor maker successfully tapping into the boom in artificial intelligence, slid 27%; and Sorted, the retail delivery management platform that has had a more difficult 18 months, halved.
All this is backward looking, of course. In its statements today and yesterday, Chrysalis reiterated the message it gave in December's capital markets day that two-thirds of the portfolio was either profitable or expected to be funded to profitability. Another 14% is in businesses with enough cash to survive the next two years.
With marketing specialist Brandtech, the fund's second biggest holding, and even Klarna, now relegated to ninth position in the portfolio, among those said to be growing quickly, the managers were upbeat.
'We believe the portfolio is attractively valued versus listed peers, particularly given its rate of growth. We continue to be pleased by the overall trading performance of the portfolio and of the major holdings in particular,' Watts and Williamson stated today.
With the shares closing on a 40% discount to the December NAV on Wednesday, Chrysalis clearly offers some kind of value. However, the adverse reaction shows investors' concerns at the latest write-downs and the challenge Chrysalis still faces with stock markets closed to new flotations.
With IPO exits for the moment closed, Chrysalis yesterday set out its three options for the 19% of the portfolio that is unprofitable. These are:
Follow-on funding from Chrysalis, which has PS66m in cash and PS12m of shares it can sell in Wise, the money transfer specialist
Follow-on from other investors that would dilute the fund's stake
Selling stakes to another investor or trade buyer
In the current environment, any of these options could involve further big cuts in valuation.
'We think the NAV remains vulnerable to funding downrounds at some of the underlying companies, and we had been projecting NAV declining to around the 120p level, with us now getting close to this,' said Scouller.
Numis Securites, a corporate broker to Chrysalis, agreed the bigger-than-expected write-down in the last quarter could draw a line under last year and start to restore investor confidence. 'The share price had been implying investors were expecting more write-downs and we believe that it is healthy to see the NAV reach a level where investors may start to believe the valuations are conservative,' Numis said.
What would really help improve the share price rating and narrow the wide discount is another disposal, such as that of adviser investment platform Embark, on which Chrysalis doubled its money in a sale to Lloyds bank in 2021.
Another gain like this in the absence of further write-downs could see the depressed shares start to bounce back this year. At the moment that feels like a lot to hope for, but if the recession is shallow rather than deep, it might be possible.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/chrysalis-can-t-escape-2022-horror-show-as-it-looks-to-sell-stragglers/a2408144,8
2023-02-01,a2408130,Net-zero group requires PE decarbonisation targets in 2023,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,New guidelines up pressure on alternatives by asking the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance to bring in decarbonisation targets for private equity and commercial real estate loans.,"The 84 members of the United Nations-backed Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) will need to set decarbonisation targets for private equity portfolios this year and cover all private equity assets by 2025.
The third edition of the Target-Setting Protocol published yesterday (31 January) outlined significant changes to the guidelines for NZAOA members in their net-zero transition - including more stringent requirements for alternatives.
Gunther Thallinger, board member of Allianz SE and Alliance, said there is a 'divergence of real-economy emission pathways and scientific pathways for limiting temperature rise to 1.5C'.
Thallinger added the protocol is meant to increase expectations for NZAOA members and call on policymakers and corporates to move in line with science.
The members, who combined manage more than $11tn in assets, are now being asked to phase in decarbonisation targets for new commercial real estate loans using the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor 1.5C national pathways or the IPCC's no or limited overshoot 1.5C global range.
Also, from next year, members will have to report the share of portfolios covered by the newly announced disclosure target on all new investments.
The framework also introduces guidance on carbon accounting for sovereign debt, using assessment and accounting standards the NZAOA is currently developing with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) and Assessing Sovereign Climate-related Opportunities and Risks (Ascor).
Once finalised, the new standards are expected to offer a common understanding of sovereign exposure and climate alignment.
The framework also echoes NZAOA's previous statements on carbon removal by 'disallowing' its members from using carbon removals to achieve short-term reduction targets, and instead prioritise emission reductions.
Members are also asked to focus on climate solution investments in emerging markets, on the basis that these regions generally have fewer resources to transition away from fossil fuel dependency yet are most impacted by climate change - a prominent theme to emerge from COP27 via the so-called 'Loss and Damage' fund.
As of September 2022, 44 of the NZAOA members had set Paris-aligned targets to decrease their financial emissions by 2025. Investors representing $3.3tn in assets had also set sub-portfolio emission targets for 2030 or sooner, compared to just $1.1tn in 2021.",https://citywireselector.com/news/net-zero-group-requires-pe-decarbonisation-targets-in-2023/a2408130,0

Having previously managed funds in Europe, I understand how this unique investment strategy benefits investors who are seeking consistency in returns, less volatility and require superior sustainability.'
He added Pella was pleased to have partnered with the German groups Universal Investment and CAPinside, who will manage distribution and administration capabilities for the Ucits-compliant product.

The Credit Suisse (Lux) Energy Evolution Equity fund will target 'pure-play' ideas in the energy sector and tap into companies generating at least 50% of their revenue from aiding the transition away from a fossil fuel-based economy.

Based on a bottom-up investment approach, the fund will focus on three of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): SDG 7, which covers affordable and clean energy; SDG 9, which covers industry, innovation and infrastructure; and SDG 13, which covers climate action.
The fund is domiciled in Luxembourg and marks the seventh thematic strategy the asset manager has launched. Other funds cover robotics, security, digital health, edutainment, environmental impact and infrastructure.

The blue-chip index rose 0.3%, or 24p, to 7,795 in early trading after Wall Street rallied, with the S&P 500 advancing 1.5% on hopes the Fed will start to sound more dovish if it raises its funds rate for an eighth time since last March to a new range of 4.5% to 4.75%.
Hargreaves Lansdown UK portfolio manager Steve Clayton said: 'The key may well be what the Fed says, rather than what it does.
'Inflation has been falling for a while now in the US and many analysts believe this will be the last increase, to be followed by a lull before the Fed then moves to begin cutting rates later this year.'
Clayton said 'a lot of money rides on this so-called Fed pivot', with the US central bank likely to set the tone for rate decisions by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.
Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said complacency around the Fed decision 'sets up for a volatility-driven event' if Fed chair Jerome Powell pushes back.
'There is no reason for the Fed to signal a pause,' he said. 'Financial conditions have loosened considerably, inflation remains high, the labour market tight, and commodity-linked inflation could be rearing its head again. However, as we have seen countless times, the market is willing to take a dovish read to just about anything the Fed says.'
Online grocer Ocado (OCDO) led the FTSE higher, adding 3.1%, or 20p, to 666p. Safety technology group Halma (HLMA) gained 2.4%, or 53p, at PS22.01, after acquiring fire detection product manufacturer Thermocable.
Gambling group Entain (ENT) rose 2.3%, or 34p, to PS15.23, after lifting its profit forecast and reporting a 12% rise in quarterly online gaming revenue thanks to the football World Cup. Last week, the group said its joint venture with MGM Resorts in the US is also expected to turn profitability in the second half of this year.
The FTSE 250 climbed 0.7%, or 147 points, to 20,000, led by electrical retailer Currys (CURY), which jumped 4.5%, or 2p, to 67p. It was followed by professional services group FDM (FDM), which advanced 4%, or 29p, at 817p, after confirming full-year performance would be in line with expectations, with annual revenues growing 23%.
In investment company news, UK Commercial Property (UKCM ) slid 3.8% to 55.6p after rising government bond yields knocked 21% off the net asset value (NAV) of its industrial-heavy portfolio in the last quarter. Abrdn fund manager Will Fulton said the challenging macroeconomic backdrop had impacted property valuations across the industry.
The news did not read across to Schroder European Real Estate (SERE ), which gained 3.2% to 82.8p, narrowing its wide 35% discount to NAV.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/ftse-edges-higher-ahead-of-fed-rate-decision/a2408113,8
2023-02-01,a2408139,Abrdn hires from pensions giant for vacant CIO position,News at organisational level,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Christopher Johnson,Peter Branner joins from Dutch pensions firm APG Asset Management as chief investment officer after Rod Paris retired from the position at the end of 2021.,"Abrdn has hired Peter Branner as chief investment officer (CIO) from European pensions giant APG Asset Management.
The CIO position had been vacant at the Scottish-headquartered asset manager since Rod Paris retired at the end of 2021.
Branner will be responsible for simplifying Abrdn's product offering and refocusing the investment business on areas with the most growth potential.
He joins from EUR580bn (PS512.6bn) Dutch pension fund firm APG, where he worked as CIO for more than four years.
Prior to that, he was CEO and CIO of SEB Investment Management based in Stockholm for close to a decade. Here he developed the firm's range of funds and institutional mandates.
He also acted as CIO at Fortis Investments' multi-management division in London and was the managing director of IKANO Fund Management in Luxembourg.
In his new role at Abrdn, Branner will report to Chris Demetriou and Rene Buehlmann, co-CEOs of investments.
Demetriou said Branner joining the firm marks a 'new chapter' for the business.
In December it was announced that Abrdn's chief financial officer Stephanie Bruce would be leaving the firm in the coming months.
A tough period
Abrdn had a tough 2022, with a huge swathe of outflows resulting in its assets under management falling from PS542bn at the start of the year to PS508bn at the end of June.
This was driven partly by outflows from Lloyds pulling almost PS25bn in pension assets, with PS25bn moved away earlier in the year.
Under CEO Stephen Bird, the group has pivoted away from its roots as an asset manager and invested heavily in technology, with its PS1.5bn acquisition of direct-to-consumer platform Interactive Investor earlier in 2022.
In December Abrdn rejoined the FTSE 100 in a reshuffle after being dropped from the blue-chip index in September.
The relegation came as the asset manager's share price dipped 41% last year, leaving its market cap languishing below PS3.2bn.
Abrdn's current year-to-date share price is up 12.3% to 211p versus the FTSE 100, which is up 3% over the same period.",https://citywireselector.com/news/abrdn-hires-from-pensions-giant-for-vacant-cio-position/a2408139,0

2023-02-02,a2408347,AllianceBernstein EM value chief and four PMs join boutique,Changes in the Investment Team,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Will Schmitt,Destination revealed for experienced fund manager with new long/short product in the works.,"A veteran AllianceBernstein emerging markets portfolio manager and his team have left the firm and joined Ariel Investments.
Henry Mallari-D'Auria, previously the CIO of emerging markets value at AB, where he worked for more than 30 years, will join Ariel in mid-April, according to a statement by Ariel co-CEOs John Rogers Jr. and Mellody Hobson.
He will be joined at Ariel by former AB portfolio managers Vlad Byalik and Christine Phillpotts, and senior research analysts Slava Breusov and Ted Mann. Ariel's statement noted that Mallari-D'Auria planned to hire one analyst and at least two more associates to build out his team.
'When an accomplished leader expressed an interest in working with us, a dedicated emerging markets strategy became our next natural product extension,' Hobson and Rogers said.
Mallari-D'Auria's team will be based in New York City, sharing space with Ariel's alternatives team for the time being.
Mallari-D'Auria previously was a named manager on the $1bn AB Emerging Markets
fund. That strategy earned a 2.95% annualised return over the past three years, beating the Diversified Emerging Markets category average of 2.1%.
Separately, Ariel, which has its headquartered in Chicago, has announced plans to launch a new global long/short strategy under the guidance of Micky Jagirdar, the firm's head of investments for global equities.
'We will be the first to acknowledge that launching a dedicated new asset class and a product extension in the same year is indeed unusual for us,' Rogers and Hobson stated. 'That said, we decided to take advantage of a rare opportunity to bring a skilled team on board while also capitalising on a colleague's expertise and experience to collectively advance Ariel's global investing platform.'
Rogers and Hobson also noted that they themselves had no plans to leave any time soon, citing 'an uncommon co-leadership model that works'.
'We want to underscore our own commitment to our leadership roles at Ariel for many years to come,' Hobson and Rogers said.

2023-02-02,a2408124,Post-pandemic dividend recovery stalls as mining payouts drop,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jamie Colvin,"UK dividends likely to be flat as reduced payouts from miners are not wholly replaced by higher distributions from banks and oil giants, says Link Group.","The post-pandemic boost in 'catch-up' dividends ran out of steam last year as special one-off payments dropped by a third to PS9.5bn, said Link Group as it forecast overall distributions to UK investors would be flat this year.
Mining, the top dividend-paying sector over the last two years, saw payouts decline in the second half of 2022 as commodity prices eased, while banks and oil companies increased dividends as interest rates and energy prices rose.
Despite the decline for miners, the sector is not at risk of losing its number one status, according to Link's latest quarterly UK Dividend Monitor. Mining dividends accounted for PS1 in every PS6 distributed by UK companies in 2022, double their average over the last decade. The sector would need to see its payouts fall by 33% to lose the top-paying sector status, Link said, which is unlikely.
'The biggest uncertainty is what happens in the mining sector,' said Ian Stokes, managing director of UK and Europe corporate markets at Link Group. 'Our base case is that mining payouts will continue the fall that began in the middle of 2022, but commodity prices have recovered a little recently, and coal, a significant earner for Glencore (GLEN), is enjoying the energy price boom.
'Banking and oil should remain the biggest growth drivers and we are anticipating GSK's large spin-off Haleon paying its first dividend too.'
A year ago Link predicted miners would not repeat 2021's PS15.3bn bonanza as commodity prices rocketed after the pandemic. This forecast proved wrong, however, as commodity prices soared after Russia's invasion Ukraine, leading to payouts of PS16bn. In 2022, banks paid out PS10.2bn and oil and energy firms, PS9.8bn.
Banks are enjoying a boost in profit margins as interest rates climb, paying shareholders 80% more in 2022, including special dividends, accounting for one-quarter of the underlying increase. Oil dividends rose by a quarter last year, despite huge sums spent in share buybacks.
Link Group forecasts an underlying UK payout increase to PS86.2bn, a 1.7% gain on 2022, although 2023 will see headline payouts fall 2.8% thanks to lower special dividends, believes Stokes.
'We do expect underlying dividends to grow in 2023. Companies would rather reduce share buybacks than cut dividends. With the former so high, there is plenty of wiggle room, though corporate cash balances have been depleted by the record share buybacks,' Stokes said.
Special dividends totalling PS9.5bn were above the longer-term average after significant one-offs from Aviva (AV), Natwest (NWG) and Glencore.
The ongoing recovery after the steep cuts made during the pandemic extended to the FTSE 250-listed mid-cap companies last year, which saw a headline dividend growth of 5% and an underlying 23.8% growth excluding special dividends.
Growth continued into the last quarter at 18.2%, driven by industrials, financials and the restoration of ITV's interim payout, having brought back its final dividend earlier in the year.
Link anticipates a year of slower growth for the mid-caps as they feel the pinch from a UK recession, although the Bank of England believes the downturn could be shallower than it feared in November.
Record share buybacks last year diverted cash away from dividends as boards chose to enhance returns on the remaining equity capital. In the fourth quarter, buybacks reduced dividends by PS300m, particularly across the oil, tobacco, food and retail sectors, Link estimates, with mining and chemicals softer than estimated.
Oil giant Shell (SHEL) bought back more than 8% of its shares last year, equivalent to PS16bn, and the UK as a whole spent PS50bn, double 2021's total.
A weak pound in 2022 added PS3.8bn to the value of UK payouts as more than two-thirds of FTSE 100 companies declare payments in dollars or euros.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/post-pandemic-dividend-recovery-stalls-as-mining-payouts-drop/a2408124,6
2023-02-02,a2408272,Hargreaves backs Peel Hunt's RetailBook in battle for DIY investors,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jamie Colvin,Peel Hunt secures backing of Hargreaves Lansdown for spin-off of its Rex technology platform a week after PrimaryBid and Winterflood join forces.,"Stockbrokers' efforts to improve private investors' access to flotations and share issues have stepped up, with Peel Hunt securing the backing of Hargreaves Lansdown for the spin-off of its Rex technology platform.
Rex, which enables investors to participate in initial public offerings and secondary fundraisings through retail brokers, is being relaunched as RetailBook, a standalone company to Peel Hunt, with its own office and staff.
Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK's biggest retail stockbroker, has committed to using the service exclusively until June. It is being offered a stake in the business, as are institutional brokers Jefferies, Numis, and Rothschild, which have also agreed to work with and promote RetailBook.
Peel Hunt CEO Steven Fine said it was time for Rex 'to spread its wings as a separate entity'.
Hargreaves Lansdown boss Chris Hill stated: 'We are delighted to be working with Rex to help allow our clients fair access to capital markets and secondary fundraisings to avoid dilution on transactions.
'It is hugely important that retail investors are not ignored in this growing market and that their voice is heard.'
Peel Hunt says Rex, launched in 2015, has been gaining market share and been involved in nine corporate fundraisings since August, including half of the share issues that have included retail investors. A total of PS450m has been raised from individuals, it says.
The relaunch comes at a tough time for City brokers, with capital markets largely frozen since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last year, for the first time since 1978, there were no new investment companies launched on the London Stock Exchange after a busy 2021 for closed-end fund flotations.
RetailBook faces competition from the PrimaryBid app, which since 2016 has sought to connect listed companies and private investors. Last week it teamed up with Peel Hunt rival Winterflood to offer its interface to retail brokers wanting to enhance their offering.
The regulatory obstacles discouraging listed companies from raising money through private investors - who hold an estimated PS300bn in ISAs - have become a target for the government. It wants to broaden private sector and pension fund investment in infrastructure and startups and has commissioned two Treasury reviews on the subject. They have both proposed cutting red tape to ensure there is a level playing field between retail and institutional investors.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/hargreaves-backs-peel-hunt-s-retailbook-in-battle-for-diy-investors/a2408272,2
2023-02-02,a2408278,Equity chief questions long-term morality of Inflation Reduction Act,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Krystle Higgins,Mediolanum's Terry Ewing believes the landmark legislation provides ample opportunities across green energy sectors but European providers could find themselves lagging.,"The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may not be the best moral path for the world to go down, even if it does provide ample opportunities for many equities, according to Mediolanum's head of equities, Terry Ewing.
Speaking to Citywire Selector, Ewing said that regardless of any personal views on the Act, which covers around $390bn in spending, it has come at the right time for the equities space.
Sectors including clean energy, hydrogen, carbon capture and electric cars will have billions of dollars thrown at them as a result of the legislation, Ewing said.
The IRA, which passed in Washington in August 2022, offers companies billions of dollars to boost investment in clean energy technologies. Firms will be rewarded for reorienting supply chains to be located either in the US or allied countries.
'The war in Ukraine has created this imperative to change the grid and reduce carbon emissions, which goes hand in hand with the strategic wish of the US to not just hand out money that ends up in China, but to make sure that money is invested in US companies,' said Ewing.
'Rightly or wrongly, however, you can argue that this may not be the right way to go morally for the world.'
Ewing's comments come as EU government leaders prepare for a Brussels summit next week where they will discuss a potential $270bn package designed to remain competitive on this front.
Europe is now viewed as lagging in an area where it was once leading. It is being urged to develop equivalent policy to remain competitive while maintaining an equal trading playing field, which is fundamental to its principles.
Pure market impact
Ewing said the IRA has potentially come at a sweet spot, when equity markets are looking to invest in more quality and value sectors.
'The equity markets from 2015 through to the vaccine rally in October 2020 and to the end of 2021 were dominated by growth. It is now important for companies to have more value and quality characteristics.'
Ewing said that almost every company on the planet has a chief financial officer who is focused on reducing power consumption. This shift in focus will provide ample opportunities to sectors offering to reduce companies' data power and carbon consumption.
'If you are a semiconductor chip company and your new semiconductor uses much less power in a data centre [which collectively are expected to consume 8% of the world's electricity by 2030], then your chips are going to be much more in demand.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/equity-chief-questions-long-term-morality-of-inflation-reduction-act/a2408278,1

2023-02-02,a2408268,'Dovish' Bank of England hikes but raises hopes UK rates will peak at 4.5%,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Alicja Hagopian,Bank's monetary policy committee lifts interest rates from 3.5% to 4% as expected but softens language around further hikes as inflationary squeeze on economy abates.,"The Bank of England has raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 4% but dropped a previous reference to the need to 'forcefully' hike rates in the fight against inflation.
The more dovish language from the monetary policy committee (MPC) caused the pound to fall against the dollar as markets predicted interest rates would now peak at 4.5% in the summer after the MPC predicted a shallower recession than it had previously forecast. Sterling slid 0.5% to $1.2321.
MPC members voted 7-2 in favour of lifting the base rate from 3.5%, its tenth consecutive increase, which puts the cost of borrowing at its highest since the 2008 financial crisis. The two dissenters voted to keep the rate unchanged.
The MPC said subsiding energy prices meant the UK economy's 0.3% contraction in the third quarter of last year was less than it had expected in November.
As a result, it now believes GDP will fall only 0.5% this year, compared with the 1.5% decline in its previous forecast.
Similarly, the rate setters predict consumer prices index (CPI) inflation will fall to 4% by the end of the year, below the 5.25% forecast previously. CPI fell slightly to 10.5% in December.
The MPC's decision comes as central banks strike a less hawkish tone after signs that inflation has peaked. Last night, as expected, the US Federal Reserve slowed its pace of monetary tightening with a 0.25 percentage point rise to 4.5%-4.75%. Fed chair Jerome Powell reassured markets by stating that a 'disinflationary process' had started.
The softening in the MPC's language was evident in the statement. It said if inflation proved more persistent than expected, 'further tightening will be required'. This replaced the Bank's earlier commitment to 'respond forcefully' on interest rates.
David Goebel, investment strategist at wealth manager Evelyn Partners, said: 'Prior to the meeting, expectations for future increases in rates were modest - perhaps another cumulative 50 basis points before peaking at the June or August meetings.
'This represents a considerable downgrade on what markets expected in November, which was for rates to reach around 5.25%, and caused [Bank of England] governor Andrew Bailey to suggest they were too high. Market expectations now seem fairly in line with the Bank.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/dovish-bank-of-england-hikes-but-raises-hopes-uk-rates-will-peak-at-4-5/a2408268,1
2023-02-02,a2408220,Abrdn engages with mining giants over sexist culture claims,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,John Schaffer,The asset manager has issued a statement on how it is engaging with its largest mining holdings after widespread reports of sexual harassment within Australia's mining industry.,"Abrdn has released a statement addressing toxic workplace behaviours at some of its largest holdings.
The letter follows several incidences of sexual harassment reported by women working in Western Australia's mining industry.
Workers at Australia's richest mining companies, including BHP and Rio Tinto, said there were claims of assaults, unsolicited nude photos and innuendo.
'The sector is often criticised for its social impacts. More recently, these have been centred on unacceptable workplace behaviours, illustrated by incidences of sexual harassment and assault in Australia and elsewhere in the world,' the asset manager said in the statement.
'From an investment perspective, performance that fails to meet stakeholder expectations can lead to operational disruption and reputational damage.'
The statement comes ahead of the African Mining Indaba, one of the world's largest mining conferences, which takes place on Monday.
Last April Abrdn announced it would be abstaining from votes on Rio Tinto's company reports and accounts after an investigation by Australian former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick revealed a culture of bullying, sexual harassment and racism.
Almost half of the 10,000 respondents to the survey on the miner said they had been bullied by a 'culture of silence'.
Abrdn added in the statement that mining firms should use 'all the tools they have available' to improve workplace behaviour, diversity and inclusion. The asset manager said it had been undertaking 'focused engagement' with its larger mining holdings over the past two years.
'Many mining companies have demonstrated a strong track record in improving health and safety, embedding aspects into all areas of their organisational cultures and business processes. We believe that employees' psychological wellbeing warrants a similar approach.'
Industry reacts
Several large miners have been supportive of Abrdn's engagement statement, including BHP, Rio Tinto and Anglo American. Industry body the International Council on Mining and Metals has also pledged its support.
BHP CEO Mike Henry said the firm was making 'strong progress' on creating a respectful culture.
'We are wholly committed to eliminating unwelcome behaviours at BHP, including sexual harassment, bullying and racism. Everyone who comes to our sites has the right to thrive,' Henry said.
Rio Tinto CEO Jakob Stausholm said the firm was implementing the 26 recommendations from last year's Broderick report.

2023-02-02,a2408157,McLemore stresses power of time horizons in Bill Miller handover note,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,Protege-turned-boutique boss outlines the need for long-term thinking and how consistency will be key for the next chapter.,"Samantha McLemore has issued a candid state-of-play note for her value-focused investment style, which marks her time under mentor Bill Miller and how she expects to stay true to long-term lessons.
The note - beginning with the Seneca quote: 'Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end' - marks the first lengthy commentary since Miller retired from fund management in December.
As part of succession plans announced last year, McLemore is to absorb Miller's Opportunity Trust
into her Patient Capital, while Citywire + rated Bill Miller IV takes the reigns of Miller Value Partners.
In her note, McLemore cited several examples from Morgan Housel's book The Psychology of Money, which shows how quiet and considered compounding works out well for seemingly low activity or even inactive investors, which was why she named her boutique accordingly.
'Time is your biggest ally in this business, which is why I chose the name Patient Capital for the firm.
'For us, 2023 brings a remarkable opportunity for reflecting on change. As Bill Miller steps off as portfolio manager of the Opportunity strategy and we prepare for Patient Capital to take over that business, along with its supporting organisation, much will change. Yet it's what endures that's likely more important.
'Our philosophy and process, which have demonstrated success for over 40 years, won't change. There will be continuity in both the investment and operational teams. Bill will remain an advisor, mentor, investor and friend; we will continue to benefit from his valuable perspective.
'On a more mundane level, we will continue to go to the same office. It's more a picture of continuity than change. That's not to say we underestimate the change. We have an amazing opportunity in front of us. We couldn't be more excited about the future.'
What comes next?
In her missive, McLemore outlined how she had thanked Miller for his 20 years of tutelage and that she intended to extend the principles of long-term, value-discipline, independent thinking and flexibility as she takes the lead position.
'Our philosophy and process, which have demonstrated success for over 40 years, won't change. There will be continuity in both the investment and operational teams.'
However, she said the hyperefficient world of short-term, data-led investing poses a unique challenge and she was open about the fund's recent poor performance.
In the 12 months to the end of December 2022, the fund lost 36.6% and was 925th out of 951 funds in Citywire's US Equity Blend sector. For context, strategies in the sector fell 19.1% on average over the same period.
'Our results have disappointed and diverged from most value managers recently. That's primarily attributable to our willingness to invest early in companies we believe are long-term secular winners. These securities remain strong contributors to our longer-term results.
'A small percentage of companies (4%) drive all the market's wealth creation over long periods of time. It would seem sensible, then, to identify these opportunities. And we do.
'The very best value investors benefited from investing early in companies that compound(ed) capital over long periods (Buffett and Ben Graham with Geico; Bill Miller with Amazon). But many rule them out based on accounting metrics that appear expensive.
'We explicitly look for these sorts of opportunities as part of our process. This has significantly enhanced our long-term performance. Amazon, RH and Farfetch (given our sales at higher prices) are all top contributors over the last decade.'
McLemore calls time on Ucits version of flagship fund as assets drop
The largest positions in the fund at the end of December 2022, according to company data, were a 5.3% exposure to travel booking group Expedia and a 5.3% allocation to hydrocarbon exploration specialist Ovintiv. The $1.28bn fund has a 38.8% exposure to consumer discretionary stocks at a sector level.
Tide turning?
McLemore said the market was nearing a two-year mark for bearish performance among 'innovation' stocks, which she said could be coming to an end. However, any upside could be curtailed by continued fears of a significant recession in the US market.
'Many names price in a recession. Consumer discretionary stocks lost 37% in 2022 as valuations corrected, and the market discounted a looming recession. That loss equals the entire loss suffered by the group in the early 2000s. That recession was mild.
'The financial crisis recession of 2007-2009 certainly was not. During that bear market, consumer discretionary declined 42%. We're close to that. We think this bodes well for our consumer and cyclical stocks, which account for a sizeable chunk of the portfolio.
'As for ""innovation stocks"", selectivity is key. Most early-stage innovators fail to outperform. Yet some will likely be the biggest wealth creators. We continue to turn over stones in search of those opportunities.'
While the portfolio has been dragged down by growth names and cyclical ideas, McLemore said the 'extreme levels' these investments have reached might be addressable.
'There are good odds that 2023 will be a strong year for us. A year where the market can focus more on company fundamentals than macro, which is helpful to our style. We couldn't be more excited about the portfolio's prospects, whatever ephemeral forces it faces.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/mclemore-stresses-power-of-time-horizons-in-bill-miller-handover-note/a2408157,7
2023-02-02,a2408128,Where this elite sustainable infrastructure PM is buying,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,KBI's Colm O'Connor took advantage of the early 2022 dislocation to add exposure to key energy names.,"The transition to a greener, cleaner future was unlikely to be smooth, and the ructions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the knock-on effects on the global energy complex have added further challenges.
Investors looking at energy transition and green infrastructure investments need to retain a long-term time horizon and weather short-term noise, according to KBI's Colm O'Connor.
Dublin-based O'Connor runs the EUR1.45bn KBI Global Sustainable Infrastructure
and EUR1.15bn KBI Global Energy Transition
funds with Noel O'Halloran and Martin Conroy.
Speaking to Citywire and focusing on the former strategy, O'Connor said infrastructure opportunities specifically appeared in the latter half of 2022, as discounts emerged due to the volatility caused by gas price pressure from Russia's aggression in Eastern Europe.
'Most of the opportunities in the Global Sustainable Infrastructure strategy appeared over the second half of 2022 following a period of dislocation in the market due to concerns over volatility and high prices,' O'Connor said.
'We did see a lot of investors get worried at the start of the year, which weighed on some of these companies despite their long-term potential.
'We saw some central European names, such as Enel and Eon, which we own in the portfolio, affected by negative sentiment. But we saw that as an opportunity more than anything as they tended to get caught in the general sector share price decline but with better fundamentals.'
Italian utilities group Enel, which was first bought in mid-2018, is the largest single position in the fund, accounting for 5.61% of exposure, while Eon, which was purchased around the same time, is a 3.32% holding.
What is Citywire Fix The Future?O'Connor has held European utilities as a prime area of investment in the fund in recent years.
'We have a preference for European utilities as they are further along in terms of their journey towards the energy transition and net zero.'
The latest fund factsheet indicates that the KBI Global Sustainable Infrastructure has 65.1% allocated to utilities, which compares with an average weighting of 46.8% in its Morningstar category, Equity Infrastructure. In fact, seven of the fund's top 10 positions are listed as utility stocks.
'We did see a de-rating of good stocks last year, but utilities have always been a cornerstone of our portfolio. Exposure to European utilities has always been more about increasing or maintaining a strong position. Within that, we are able to weight towards different sub-sectors, such as renewable energy generation and the more general energy distribution names.'
Citywire-sourced data indicates O'Connor added exposure in August 2022 to utilities group Edison International, a 1.25% holding, and scientific and technical instruments group Itron, a 1.12% holding.
He said the fund has not made major changes but has looked to rebalance itself based on where profits have been earned.
'Engineering and consulting names performed very well in 2022, specifically those involved in the build-out and design of infrastructure projects. This is an area we have been trimming following recent strong performance.'
Looking at the broader portfolio, real estate is the only other sector with double-digit exposure, accounting for 12.5% of investments, while industrials is currently running at an underweight to the wider category. Here, O'Connor only has 9.7% of the fund exposed.
The KBI Global Sustainable Infrastructure fund is seventh in its 103-strong Citywire Equity - Infrastructure sector over the three-year period to the end of December 2022. It returned 32% in US dollar terms against an average return of 5.3%.
Meanwhile, the KBI Global Energy Transition fund sits fourth out of 26 strategies in Citywire's Equity - Clean Energy sector over the same period. It returned 80.1% over this time frame, while the average peer delivered 47.8%.",https://citywireselector.com/news/where-this-elite-sustainable-infrastructure-pm-is-buying/a2408128,6

In moves first reported by Citywire Selector's sister site Citywire Deutschland, the asset manager intends to roll its German-specific equities team into the wider European equities set-up.
Albrecht, who had been with the group for 25 years, had been head of DACH equities and was responsible for the DWS Deutschland
fund, which had grown to EUR3.5bn in assets during his tenure. He cedes responsibility for the fund to Marcus Poppe.
It marks the second time Albrecht has announced his departure from the Frankfurt-headquartered firm. In September 2018 it was announced he was joining rival Berenberg as head of German equities before completing a sensational U-turn just two months later to stay with DWS.
In the latest set of moves at DWS, Poppe will also work with Philipp Schweneke to lead the newly integrated European equities team, with all major changes set to come into effect from 1 March 2023.
Poppe will relinquish his deputy PM role on the DWS Top Dividende
fund as a result of the change. In his stead, Madeline Ronner and Jarrid Klug will become deputy portfolio managers. This EUR20.2bn fund is currently overseen by veteran income investor Thomas Schussler.
In addition, Poppe will handover his roles on the DWS Smart Industrial Technologies
and DWS Invest ESG Smart Industrial Technologies
funds to Ronner.
Meanwhile, Sabrina Reeh will take over management of the DWS ESG Investa , which has EUR3.8bn and is managed by Christoph Ohme. It was not revealed whether Ohme was staying with the firm as a result of the shake-up.

Lanctot had been a named portfolio manager on the fund since December 2019, when both he and Berelowitz were added to support Shah.
It marks the second change in just six months for the strategy, as Virginia Martin Heriz left the global macro team for a different position within JPM AM in October 2022.

Faure was most recently head of responsible development at fellow French asset manager Comgest. Her appointment there was announced at the start of 2022, although it is understood she had been in the role since the end of 2021.
In this position, Faure sat on the company's responsible investment committee and was applauded for her previous work and expertise in coordinating complex ESG projects.
In her new post with Sienna IM, Faure will help guide the group's sustainability and impact investment efforts within alternative asset management.
Prior to her time at Comgest, she worked for the French asset management association, AFG, as head of sustainable investment. She also previously worked as a senior product manager in charge of business development for equity and impact strategies at Mirova.
Commenting on the hire, Paul de Leusse, CEO of Sienna IM, said: 'The management of liquid and especially real assets - debt, equity, real estate - is particularly well suited for the development of impact strategies. Alix's expertise and strong leadership skills will be key to better meet the expectations of our clients and other stakeholders in this area.'

The Ohio-based group has gained headlines over the past year for its attempts to counter more ESG-conscious products with a focus on areas it believes are overlooked. This has seen the launch of tech, energy and US equity offerings.
The Strive Emerging Markets Ex-China ETF, known as STXE, will focus on large- and mid-cap equity securities across 24 emerging market economies, excluding China, offering investors exposure to emerging markets while minimising China-related risks.
In accompanying literature, the group said: 'Strive believes that China's autocratic regime, economic vulnerabilities, and military posture towards its neighbours, including Taiwan, create meaningful risks for global investors.
'Strive believes that other large environmental, social, and governance (ESG) promoting financial institutions with asset management businesses in China are unable to adequately educate US clients about these risks due to their conflicts of interests in China.'
The fund is launching with $100m in seed capital from unnamed institutional investors and marks the asset manager's first foray into non-US-centric products.
Strive added that the conflicts of interest many traditional asset managers have with China means the companies they invest in are not subject to the same levels of ESG scrutiny as US firms. The company's founders also pledged never to launch an asset management operation in China, as many of its rivals have done.
'ESG-promoting asset managers are vocal about supposed investment risks relating to board diversity and climate change, yet they are conspicuously silent about one of the most proximal investment risks that all investors face: the behaviours of Communist China,' said Vivek Ramaswamy, executive chairman and co-founder of Strive.",https://citywireselector.com/news/anti-woke-etf-shop-takes-aim-at-china-with-latest-launch/a2408386,0

Gavin Lumsden: Hello Simon, it's been a few months since you picked up a Citywire award for Merchants, as the best performing UK equity income investment trust. So, I'm interested to know how you're feeling about the investment landscape now? At the end of last year, you sounded increasingly optimistic about the prospects for the UK stock market Has that positivity extended into the new year?
Simon Gergel: Hi, Gavin. Great to see you again. Yes, I think the opportunity in the market is that firstly, the stock market's very lowly priced compared to history. Secondly, there's a big dispersion of valuation. So, within the market, there's even cheaper shares, they're trading well below average. So, there's a lot of opportunities for stock pickers. Clearly, the economic environment is challenging. We've got consumer confidence issues. We've got a cost-of-living crisis. Companies have got all sorts of problems they're dealing with, but, we get the feeling that many of those issues are-, the worst is not necessarily behind us, but you can see the worst coming into view. So, if you take commodity costs like the cost of energy, that's rolling over, the oil price is coming down from where it was.
Some of those pressures are starting to alleviate. Stock markets tend to look ahead, as you know. So, we've been thinking that once people can see the peak of interest rates, the peak of mortgage costs, they can start to get a bit more excited or a bit more relaxed about the economic outlook. If you combine that with very low valuations, there are reasons to get a bit more optimistic about the opportunities in the stock market, yes.
GL: In November, Merchants lifted gearing, which is the amount the trust borrows to invest more on behalf of shareholders, to nearly 15% That's back to where it stood in early 2020, which feels significant So, have we finally got over the pandemic in terms of its impact on the businesses you invest in?
SG: Well, I think it's a good question. It's worth taking a step back and reminding ourselves why we have gearing in an investment trust. There're two reasons for having gearing. The first is, if you think you can make a better return on the investments in the portfolio than the cost of that debt, the cost of that gearing, then you should-, then having gearing will amplify the return in the long-term
The second reason for having gearing is that it can enhance the amount of income we produce and therefore, the amount of dividends we can pay out to shareholders. Of course, the flipside is, you get more volatility when markets go down. The share price and the asset value can fall faster than the market. Having said all that, we think because of the cost of debt is about 4%, it's quite reasonable, we think in the medium to long-term, we can make a better return on that. We had discussions with the board. The gearing had come down, actually, over the last year or two, partly because the companies have been issuing equity and that's brought the gearing naturally down. The board thought, along with us, that it made sense to take the gearing back up to 15%. It's till in the lower half of our 10% to 25% gearing range, but given the opportunities in the market that we see, the board thought that was a sensible decision and we were happy to do that.
GL: Are there any other signs that you've seen to make you confident about the businesses in Merchants?
SG: I think you can almost break the market down in two - it's not as simple as that - between more defensive businesses, resilient companies, food producers, businesses that, utilities, businesses that are very stable. They are generally on reasonable valuations. So decent opportunities long-term. Then the more cyclical companies, which in many cases, are on really quite depressed valuations. The cyclical companies are pricing in a lot of bad news already, which is always interesting as an equity investor. I think the second thing is, when you look at many of those businesses, they have really strong balance sheets. They've battened down the hatches. Unlike the Great Financial Crisis, we've not gone into this potential downturn with a lot of debt in many of our businesses.
So, we're finding companies we can invest in that have really good balance sheets, so strong financial position and are priced for a downturn, which means that a lot of value is already in the price. As we roll through time, either we don't get a downturn and shares might do well or we come through that period and then the shares should recover. So yes, I think there's a lot of opportunities to make money in companies on the medium to long-term.
GL: What's your outlook for the year ahead? In terms of the FTSE 100, the FTSE All-Share. I'm not going to ask you for a specific forecast where it's going to end up at the end of this year, but do you think we're going to have another choppy year or basically, moving sideways or something a bit more exciting?
SG: I find it very difficult to have a view on where the market's going and the timing. It's almost impossible to call it. What we try to do is focus on individual businesses and see if we can find companies that offer good long-term value. That tends to put us in good stead. So clearly, this year, you've got some economic challenges I referred to earlier, but you've also got great opportunities in terms of individual companies. So, we find good value in our shares I couldn't tell you whether they're going to perform this year or next year, but I think on the medium to long-term, there's some good opportunities there.
GL: Now, you referred to the dividends that you're receiving from your investments and that you then pay out to your shareholders. Given the difficult economic climate, are dividends coming under pressure again?
SG: I think it's going to be very different to what we saw either in the financial crisis or in the pandemic. In both of those situations, huge parts of the market had to cut dividends. I think things are different. There will be pressure in certain industries, in certain companies where trading is under pressure and they may have to cut dividends and we've seen one or two of those, but not that many If you take industries like banking. Banks have got far more capital than they had in the financial crisis. It's very unlikely the regulator's going to tell them to pass dividends, as they did during the pandemic and they're generating lots of cash. Even allowing for provisions for bad debt, we think banks can remain very profitable and pay good dividends.
Energy is another sector that in 2020 was losing money, if you remember, in the second quarter of 2020 and we saw big dividend cuts from the big oil companies, we don't think they're going to see that. They're generating huge amounts of cash, raising dividends, doing buybacks. So there's large parts of the market which look much better than they did in some of the previous downturns. I think you will see a few dividend cuts in certain areas, but not wholesale across the market. So generally, we're reasonably optimistic about the outlook for income It's going to, subject to those individual situations.
GL: That's encouraging. So, Christmas trading also seems to have been better than expected for many retailers. What did you learn about Next, for example, that's one of your long-term holdings, and any other retailers you hold in Merchants?
SG: We've got positions in Next (NXT), we've got positions in DFS Furniture (DFS), which is the biggest sofa retailer in the UK. What we saw at Christmas, we've got to be a bit careful. A year ago, many shops weren't fully open, or people weren't going to the shops because of Covid.
GL: So easy comparisons.
SG: Yes, so easy comparisons. So you saw the stores do very well over Christmas, but online actually, much softer because the comparisons were much tougher. More people were buying online. So even within Next, the stores did well, the online was a bit softer. Tesco, which we also own, very strong growth in the stores over Christmas, but the online was a bit weaker. So, you've got a bit of a shift, but the encouraging thing is, consumers are still out there. They're still buying. Now, the volume of what they're buying, so the revenue is up quite a bit over Christmas, the volume might be weaker because a lot of the growth has been price. Consumers are not necessarily buying as much stuff, but they are having to pay more. So, we've got to be careful how we interpret it.
I think the worst estimates or the worst fears about the consumer over Christmas haven't come through and businesses like DFS, like Next, have actually seen pretty resilient, pretty robust trading over Christmas. You know, there's a lot to go through this year. It's going to be tougher as we go through this year. The comparisons are going to get tougher. So, I wouldn't read too much into it.
GL: You've previously spoken about the opportunities in housebuilders, which you felt were oversold and indeed, stocks like Redrow (RDW) have rallied in the past three months I wondered about property developers. Real estate investment trusts like Land Securities were knocked by fears of rising interest rates last year. The Bank of England is set to continue lifting the base rate. So, what is there to be excited about a stock like Land Securities?
SG: Just going back to the interest rate question, if you look at interest rate expectations, they peaked around about the time when Liz Truss was prime minister. We had a huge spike in interest rate expectations. Mortgage rates went to 6% and actually, have been coming down since then. So, some of the worst expectations about where rates might go have eased a bit, which is helpful. If you take the real estate companies like Landsec (LAND), which you mentioned, what you're seeing is a polarisation in the market. So good space, which is relatively environmentally friendly and has a lower carbon footprint and good space which is vacant, is attracting a lot of interest. There's quite a lot of space in cities, take London, which is going to struggle to meet the next environment standards It's going to have to have a lot of money spent on it.
So, you can see, if you've got good space and Landsec's portfolio is pretty good, you should be able to get a decent amount, decent demand from your tenants. Plus there's a growing revenue growth story, income growth story from companies like Landsec, as they've got a pipeline that they can develop and build out. They made a couple of acquisitions which has given them opportunities across the UK, to do mixed urban developments and so on, which can grow the income stream. So, there's an argument here, that this company is now generating a nice level of income and can grow that income over time. Although shorter-term, there's a risk to valuations of the assets. They can move up and down and if bond yields go up a lot, then property values might go down as yields shift up. Real estate never boomed in terms of valuations. Office properties never boomed in the way that some other asset classes boomed when interest rates fell. They didn't really benefit that much.
GL: Land Securities is not doing the logistics or warehouses that got really quite expensive.
SG: Exactly. So, yields could go up, which is valuations could go down, but we don't think they're going to go up that far. The shares trade at a massive discount to the value of the assets. So, we own Landsec, we own CLS (CLI), which I think owns the building you're in here, and we see good opportunities or we have seen good opportunities in those companies.
GL: What about IG Group? Financial trading platform. Different kind of business entirely, but another of your holdings and it recently published half-year results. Were you satisfied with the figures?
SG: Yes, absolutely and I think we hear a lot about the lack of technology companies and innovation in the UK and we've got IG Group (IGG), first half of the year made over PS500m of revenue. It's going to potentially, make a billion pounds of revenue, it's expected to, this year. A 45% profit margin is what is expected from the company. So, you're talking about $450m profit. It's a world leader in what it does. It's got a rock-solid balance sheet. It's taken a strong trading activity in the UK and rolled it out across Europe, Singapore, Japan, Australia. It's now got a US business. So, it's a world leader in many areas of what it does It's a digital business. People trade online and interact with the company.
GL: Talking about markets, it's been very volatile the past three years. Philosophically, how do you seek to minimise the impact of crashes when they occur and how do you respond to those perhaps, inevitable setbacks?
SG: Unfortunately, in the last six or seven years, we've got used to periods of volatility. We had the Brexit referendum. We had market concerns about a potential change of government to a more left-wing Labour government. We've had the pandemic and we've had now, an energy crisis and the Ukraine war. So, we've got used to dealing with this volatility I think what's important, particularly when markets get a very short-term timeframe, it's to look much longer-term. To look at businesses, individual companies. Think three to five years in the future, what's this company going to be doing? How much money is it going to be making? How much cash will it generate and bringing that back to today's price? So if you get volatility there can be great opportunities.
The other thing to do is to think a lot about risk. We think about risk at the individual company level So, there's three types of risk. There's operational risk, what can go wrong in the business? There's financial risk, how much leverage have you got? And there's valuation risk, if you pay too much for a company, pay a higher valuation, you can lose money even if nothing goes wrong. Then we also think about risk at the portfolio level. Sector exposure, exposure to cyclical companies compared to defensives. Exposure to different end-markets. You want to have a diversity of risks, hopefully uncorrelated or not that correlated, with lots of good companies that can get through a tough time If you build that together and take a long-term perspective, I think that's a good way to operate That's certainly what we do.
GL: Investors don't always time their decisions right. Last year UK savers withdrew a further PS10.8bn from funds investing in UK equities, even though the UK stock market was comparatively resilient against other major markets. So as a final thought, what are those investors missing do you think? There's a world of investing out there, clearly, but what are the advantages of sticking to the UK stock market?
SG: It's a fascinating question. As you say, the UK was one of the best-performing large markets last year. Partly because of the composition of the market. More defensive exposures. I wouldn't want to speculate on what investors are missing, but what I would say is, the UK has exposure to British businesses, companies listed in the UK are often very global. The majority of profits and sales comes from overseas. So investing in the UK, you've got exposure to the global economy, but with UK standards of corporate governance and stewardship, which I think are amongst the best, if not the best in the world, which is helpful. You've also got some very interesting businesses, modest valuations and I think you're starting to see, you probably will see, some more corporate activity coming in.
I think last year, because of volatility in cash, interest rates and economic volatility, companies held back a bit, private equity funds held back from investing. I think you'll start to see corporate buyers come back for good quality UK businesses that are under-priced. So it's hard to say what investors are missing, but I see great opportunities for the UK and I think we'll start to see that level of corporate activity picking up as well.
GL: It's been a difficult few years, but there are obviously grounds for optimism for better things to come Simon, thanks very much for your time.
SG: Thank you.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/merchants-we-are-geared-for-the-uk-recovery/a2408393,11
2023-02-03,a2408304,Tweet and delete: Why Michael Burry's unique technique works,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,The Big Short mastermind has become a go-to name for the frenzied masses of financial Twitter. But his account shows zero activity.,"You can't read any tweets by one of the most influential financial people on Twitter.
This isn't some shiny new accelerant of Elon Musk's blue-tick revenue generator, where you now have to pay a premium to see individual messages from specific accounts.
No, Michael Burry has made everyone sit up and listen to what he has to say by immediately deleting anything he posts. Sounds counter-intuitive, doesn't it? But it works.
Investors are left to rely on an ancillary account called Michael Burry Archive, which exists solely to log and reproduce missives that the Big Short mastermind has removed.
Even mainstream media is left to replicate the same semi-grainy screengrabs, robbed of the ability to embed or link directly to @michaeljburry himself.
This bizarre 'tweet-and-delete' tactic reached its zenith on 1 February when it appeared Burry had completely deleted his account - again. This came just hours after he posted the single-word 'Sell', ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting.
pic.twitter.com/I5pOKfMmAn
-- Michael Burry Archive (@BurryArchive) 1 February 2023
Despite deleting it, as per his tactic, the portfolio manager was cited in several outlets as pre-empting market fallout following the latest announcement from Jerome Powell & co. But then, he was gone.
Briefly. His account was closed and reopened in the time it took this article to be written, edited and published. His 1.3m followers can breathe a sigh of relief.
The last time Burry shuttered his account was in September 2022, before returning with a quote that explained he deletes the account periodically after he perceives he has been 'cancelled in a professional or personal way'.
In May 2022, he even promised to stop deleting tweets, but then continued to do so.
It begs the question: why? Why tweet at all if you are just going to delete everything you say or even your whole account?
The truth is that Burry's words carry weight. And perhaps he knows that. Hence the call-and-retract approach, as he knows everything he says is going to be pored over, analysed and repeated. But in a digital age, nothing is ever truly deleted.
In an age of social influence, Burry's name is inextricably linked with the famous 'Big Short', and the 13F filings for his investment firm, Scion Asset Management, are combed through each quarter to see if he has unearthed the next trade of the century.
The pressure to produce content at all levels has never been higher, but not every single shot will land. And, Burry (despite being portrayed by Christian Bale in a blockbuster film about the financial crisis and the rewards he earned from that period) is scarily like a lot of us.
A man famed for his acerbic market calls - see his high-profile spat with Cathie Wood - is also likely to make anodyne comments on the politicisation of his home state, recommend a book or post endless links to various sub-genres of hard rock and metal that have caught his ear. All of this gets deleted too and doesn't make for the most compelling reading once revisited.
Nevertheless, there is something intriguing about Burry's approach. Nothing gains people's attention in a social circle like the 'This message was deleted' pop-up during a WhatsApp exchange because of the intriguing possibilities of what could have been said and hastily retracted.
In a professional context, I once joked with a PR company that the most surefire way to get world-weary journalists to read what you send out is to immediately and frantically recall it. People want to know what went wrong - why was it deleted? What mistake befell someone else but not me?
In Michael Burry's case, maybe the mistake was everyone else's, assuming he is going to produce gold every time his fingers hit the keypad when that ratio is near-impossible. People want guidance or someone smarter than them to lift the veil on what's really happening out there.
In that regard, Burry, a self-diagnosed suffered of Asperger's, has an uneasy relationship with the fame his position gained him. However, the short memories of modern living mean that when - and not if - he periodically disappears and re-emerges on the platform, the whole cycle starts again. Tweet. Delete. Rinse.

It always has and always will',Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ian Heath,M&G's fixed income veteran argues inflation will drop sooner and faster than markets expect and the economy need not suffer to achieve this.,"The biggest driver of the current decades-high inflation is oversupply of money, but central bank tightening should resolve this issue sooner than markets have priced in.
That's the view of Richard Woolnough, veteran income investor who oversees a host of strategies, including the EUR9.45bn (Lux) Optimal Income
fund, at M&G Investments.
Speaking at the asset management firm's annual investment conference in London, Woolnough said: 'One thing where I differ maybe from some others is I think the reason we have inflation is not due to the lack of supply goods, but due to the oversupply of money.
'Central banks have increased money supply tremendously since Covid-19 and lo-and-behold that means the value of money goes down. The thing I find quite awkward about this cycle is central banks have claimed it's all about supply, but none of them believe monetary supply has got anything to do with it.'
Woolnough said history proves reducing the money supply reduces inflation and the current period of rate hikes and quantitative tightening would be no different.
'When you look at the charts of US, UK and European money supply, every time it's gone in a down direction, inflation has gone down. Every time it's gone in an up direction, it's gone up. Nobody has really focused on that.
'I think inflation will come down more than the market expects because monetary policy has an effect. It always has. It always will.'
Woolnough also said the economy did not necessarily need to suffer due to monetary tightening, pointing to healthy employment statistics as evidence that this might be the case.
'The money supply affects all goods and labour is a good. Inflation puts the price of that up along with the price of everything else. But it just gets passed through. It's not damaging, because it is just changing the money supply and the denomination of money.
'If you had a EUR10 note and put a zero on every unit, you have huge inflation but what's the economic effect? Nothing. If you have EUR10 and you take a zero off, you make everything more expensive and reduce the money supply by 90%. Fine, but what's the economic effect?
'The way it is set up, the argument is the only way to kill inflation is to make people unemployed. I don't think that necessarily is the answer. You can actually kill inflation by just reducing the money supply.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/woolnough-monetary-policy-has-an-effect-it-always-has-and-always-will/a2408377,2

Galli, who joined from Amundi in January of this year, was assigned to both the JPM Emerging Markets Strategic Bond
and JPM Total Emerging Markets Income
funds on 1 February. The strategies have combined assets under management in excess of $1bn.
Baxter was a named manager on both funds. She took on the Total Emerging Markets Income fund in 2013, and was assigned to the EM Strategic Bond fund in 2015. She has been with JPM Asset Management since joining from Ashmore in 2010.
In his new capacity, Galli will work alongside Pierre-Yves Bareau, head and CIO of emerging market debt, on the $762m EM Strategic Bond fund. In addition, Turker Hamzaoglu, who has been a senior sovereign analyst, will also assume a co-portfolio manager role.
Meanwhile, Galli will also slot in on the Total EM Income fund alongside Bareau, as well as Omar Negyal and Isaac Thong. Thong was added to the Luxembourg-domiciled strategy as a co-portfolio manager in March 2022 when it was announced veteran investor Richard Titherington would be taking a leave of absence.
In performance terms, the JPM Total EM Income fund has lost 4.1% in US dollar terms over the three years to the end of December 2022, versus a sector average return of -8.7%.
Meanwhile, the JPM EM Strategic Bond fund has not fared as well over the same analysis period. It lost 10.9% in absolute terms, versus a sector average return of -1.4%.",https://citywireselector.com/news/emerging-debt-manager-exits-jpm-am-and-steps-off-funds-worth-1bn/a2408287,8

$705.4 m (EUR646.5m) LO Funds Natural Capital
The change has also affected the LOIM Plastic Circularity Strategy, which does not have publicly stated assets due to its still being in the asset-gathering stage.
A LOIM spokesperson said the firm has adopted a 'conservative approach' in relation to the interpretation of 'sustainable investment' under SFDR level 2.
This is due regulators having made it clear that they expect 100% of assets of Article 9 products to be invested in sustainable investments.
The spokesperson said: '[This] may prevent the inclusion of more neutrally-positioned investments essential for diversification, or some investments that may make a positive contribution but that may still be in transition.'
'SFDR is an important regulation for the investment industry, ensuring transparency for clients seeking to allocate capital in line with sustainable outcomes.

2023-02-03,a2408283,Jim O'Neill: Maybe I should have called them the 'Ics' not 'Brics',Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ian Heath,Renowned economist says emerging markets have driven global growth in the last two decades and India is in the 'sweet spot' to be the next China. If it doesn't miss its chance.,"India is now in a demographic 'sweet spot' which could propel it to China-like economic growth for the next two decades - if it can solve its issues with productivity, that is.
That's the view of renowned economist Jim O'Neill, who first coined the now-ubiquitous acronym 'Brics' in his 2001 paper, The World Needs Better Economic BRICs.
The abbreviation refers to the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, which O'Neill predicted were poised to rival the G7 for dominance of the global economy at the turn of the 21st century.
Speaking at M&G's annual investment conference in London, O'Neill said growth levels in the Brics countries in the last 21 years had vindicated his prediction, albeit with China and India playing an outsized role.
'The message I want to put over to you - contrary to what most international economists say to this day - world economic growth in the noughties and the last decade was stronger than in the 1980s and 1990s,' he said.
'It just so happens that most of it was driven by the Brics. The first decade was spectacular and the second decade was not, and maybe I should have called them ""Ics"" with no disrespect to anyone from Russia or Brazil.'
O'Neill, who was formerly chair of Goldman Sachs AM, said Russia and Brazil had not matched the growth of China and India due to their reliance on commodities as the staple of their economies, labelling this the 'commodities curse'.
He said he expected the Asian duo to continue to deliver high growth, but India would fare better due to its demographic advantages, especially if it can overcome internal 'complexities' and achieve better productivity.
'An important thing for people to know is that the two drivers of long-term economic growth are workforce dynamics and productivity, hence why we have India's potential growth rate being higher than China. India is now in the sweet spot.
'It's 2023 and India are now three years into a 15-year window where the growth of its labour force will be astonishing. That change between 2020 and 2035 will be as big as the absolute size of the combined labour force of Germany, France, Spain and Italy.
'If India could ever discover productivity, it could easily grow by 10% over the next two decades.'
O'Neill maintains his long-held view that emerging countries would not adopt Western principles and models as they became wealthier.
'I don't understand, and maybe it's something to do with travel or aspects of moral awareness, why so many Western thinkers still take it for granted that all these places want to be just like us,' he wondered.
'Quite a few people from China would say what is it about your wonderful system and, jokingly, your four prime ministers last year that is so appealing to us?'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/jim-o-neill-maybe-i-should-have-called-them-the-ics-not-brics/a2408283,0

Schwartz most recently was co-president of Goldman Sachs. He will be taking over from Carlyle co-founder William Conway, who had been serving as interim CEO since Lee's departure.
Lee's departure came just two years after he had become sole CEO following the exit of his co-chief executive, Glenn Youngkin.
In his new role, Schwartz will be responsible for setting a strategy to advance a diversification plan at Carlyle and identifying new investment opportunities to further scale the firm, the group said in a statement.
'Harvey is a widely respected business builder with significant leadership experience in a high-performing, highly competitive global financial institution,' co-chairmen Conway and David Rubenstein said.
'Given his experience, track record, and skillset, the board was unanimous in its determination that he is the right leader to drive Carlyle forward, building upon the firm's strong operational foundation, world-class brand, and collaborative, performance-oriented culture.'
Schwartz joined Goldman Sachs in 1997 and held a number of senior leadership positions at the investment bank including chief financial officer. He left the group in 2018 leaving David Solomon as the sole president and chief operating officer.
Carlyle lead independent director Lawton Fitt commented: 'As we look to the future, the Board is confident Harvey will leverage the firm's strengths and momentum to enhance Carlyle's position and create significant value for shareholders and all stakeholders.'

2023-02-06,a2408496,Aviva Investors make cost-of-living crisis a top engagement priority,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,"The asset manager will look unfavourably on companies protecting profitability at the expense of employees and customers, according to CEO Mark Versey.","Pay a living wage, offer financial support to lower-income employees, disclose union engagement and explore options to lower prices for vulnerable customers.
These are some of the actions Aviva Investors is asking investee companies to take as part of making the cost-of-living crisis one of its three engagement priorities in 2023, together with the low-carbon transition and reversing nature loss.
In a letter to investee company chairs, Mark Versey, CEO of Aviva Investors, said, while he expects management to explore all opportunities to deliver cost efficiencies, delaying non-essential spending and leverage their pricing power, it 'must not come at the expense of the most vulnerable stakeholders within a corporate's business model and value chain'.
The asset manager will 'look unfavourably on any attempts to protect profitability and shareholder returns through the disproportionate and excessive transfer of costs to employees, suppliers and customers', Versey wrote.
The letter states that businesses have a responsibility to protect their most vulnerable stakeholders during this period of extreme stress, and encourages boards to consider six actions to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.
Aviva Investors said companies should commit to paying a living wage for all workers and provide 'secure contracts, predictable hours and appropriate holiday and sick pay'.
This is as well as offering one-off cash payments or other temporary benefits for lower income-workers that 'lack the financial resilience to cope with current levels of inflation and interest rates'.
It also said companies must 'engage with trade unions in good faith and seek a balanced outcome recognising the impact of high inflation on real wages, and the physical and mental toll the pandemic has had on frontline workers', and encourage companies to disclose policies for engaging with unions and report on outcomes and resolutions.
Industrial action
This stance comes a week after Britain's biggest strike over public sector pay in more than a decade. Over a million workers took strike action last Wednesday (1 February), ranging from teachers, civil servants, university workers and train and bus drivers.
Aviva Investors said companies should review their approach to identifying vulnerable customers and explore ways to adapt products, services and pricing models to provide financial support.
Additionally, Aviva Investors expects companies in high-impact sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, construction and hospitality to implement the Employer Pays Principle, which is a commitment to responsible recruitment to combat exploitation, forced labour and trafficking of migrant workers.
Companies are also asked to undertake robust due diligence, establish appropriate whistleblowing and grievance mechanisms, and provide regular reporting on their efforts to eradicate modern slavery.
Featured in the list of actions is also 'showing responsibility on executive pay'.
'As the workforce are increasingly being forced to make trade-offs to afford essential spending, it would be inappropriate for highly paid executives to be fully insulated from the impacts of inflation. We expect any increases to executive base salaries to be below the average for the wider workforce,' Aviva Investors wrote.",https://citywireselector.com/news/aviva-investors-make-cost-of-living-crisis-a-top-engagement-priority/a2408496,0
2023-02-06,a2408488,IFS calls for end to 25% tax-free pension lump sum,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Nicola Blackburn,"Recommendations including NIC relief on pension contributions and reforming the 25% tax-free component would even out imbalances in pension subsidies, says the IFS.","The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has called on the government to reform the pension tax system, which it claims provides 'overly generous' tax breaks to high-income earners.
The institute has called for sweeping reforms, including changes to the 25% tax-free component for private pensions.
Currently, people can take a quarter of their pension free from income tax. The IFS said that the current policy only benefits those with high incomes and big pension pots, and has called on the government to cap the tax-free component so that it only applies to 25% of the first PS400,000 in a pension pot.
Elsewhere, the IFS is proposing that the government gives upfront employee national insurance contributions (NICs) relief on all pension contributions, and tax pension income instead. Under the current system, tax relief on taking lump sums only applies to income tax.
The IFS said this move would 'align the income tax and employee NICs systems and would benefit low and middle earners who make individual contributions, at the expense of higher earners enjoying big employer pension contributions'.
It also recommended that the lifetime allowance be reformed and called for an end to the tapering of the annual allowance. The IFS said pension benefits for defined benefit arrangements should instead be capped, while a 'lifetime contribution cap' could replace the current lifetime allowance.
The IFS said its recommendations, published today in its report A Blueprint For a Better Tax Treatment of Pensions, aimed to even out tax support for pension saving by providing greater encouragement to low-income earners.
Isaac Delestre, a research economist at the IFS, said the reforms would encourage middle earners to boost their income savings.
'Pension saving is treated generously for high earners. Even under pension caps, over PS250,000 can be withdrawn from a pension free of income tax,' he said.
'Employer pension contributions escape national insurance contributions entirely. And pensions are an easy-to-use vehicle for avoiding inheritance tax.
'At the same time, the 25% tax-free component is worthless to those who do not pay income tax in retirement. And those making individual pension contributions receive much smaller subsidies.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/ifs-calls-for-end-to-25-tax-free-pension-lump-sum/a2408488,0
2023-02-06,a2408508,EUR1.7tn investor coalition calls on governments to act on water crisis,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,"Ahead of the UN 2023 Water Conference, investors such as BNP Paribas Asset Management and Swedbank Robur have teamed up with CDP to call for more ambitious measures.","BNP Paribas Asset Management, Swedbank Robur and 29 other investors representing $1.7tn in combined assets under management are urging governments to do more to tackle the global water crisis.
In a letter published ahead of the UN 2023 Water Conference in New York City, held between 22 and 24 March, the coalition said financial institutions are being hindered by a lack of political ambition, public investment and international standards on water issues.
'The global water crisis is a systematic financial risk to nearly all economies and the climate crisis multiplies these threats,' the letter stated.
'Private financial institutions and governments each have a responsibility to act swiftly and boldly. We are urgently seeking to decrease our exposure to water risk as a core fiduciary duty and benefit from the opportunities associated with the transition to a water-secure economy.'
According to the letter, financial institutions are currently limited by 'a lack of ambitious national and international water commitments', as well as insufficient public investment in solutions needed to reverse the crisis, and a lack of internationally aligned corporate water disclosures.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change previously warned in 2021 that disastrous tipping points are nearing and system-wide action is urgently needed to reduce the vulnerability of water resources and related ecosystems.
Time for change
However, the UN 2023 Water Conference is the first time in nearly 50 years that country leaders will gather to discuss the issue of water security.
Since 1970, global freshwater species have declined by 83% according to a 2022 report by the World Wide Fund for Nature, which attributes the losses to pollution, unsustainable fishing and the damming and draining of rivers and wetlands.
The acceleration of extreme weather events and high temperatures due to climate change means supply of fresh water is going to dwindle, while the global population grows bigger, with 2.3bn people already living in water-stressed areas.
The open letter was initiated by the global disclosure system provider CDP, whose global director of water security Cate Lamb said policymakers and other financial institutions need to 'sit up and take notice'.
'The time has long since passed when we can pretend our planet's freshwater resources can be infinitely exploited. The answer is to raise awareness, mandate disclosure and act quickly on exposure to water risks,' said Lamb.
BNP Paribas Asset Management's global head of stewardship, Michael Herskovich, emphasised that current strain on the world's water resources as well as rising concerns about water quality and the stability of infrastructure means there is a need for greater political ambition.
Not yet systematically integrated
Claire Elsdon, global director of capital markets at CDP, told Citywire Selector that financial institutions' awareness of the issue is still 'quite low'.
Only 18% of around 265 financial institutions have identified water-related risks in portfolios as of last year, according to a CDP survey. Meanwhile, a third of respondents said they were still unaware of the material risk of water scarcity.
CDP has also found a large amount of engagement revolves around the subject of washing and access to sanitation, rather than the critical availability of water.
'We've got around $2.7tn worth of equity invested in [42 of the world's most water impactful companies], and yet the level of engagement with the topic is low.
'Given the intensity of the water crisis and that we're already seeing droughts, the risk of stranded assets is a concern. We're still not seeing a systematic integration of water risk [by financial institutions]. I think we could definitely see a growing risk of stranded assets in the next three to five years, if not earlier.
'Climate change is an issue which is hugely urgent but the impact of it may not be felt in the most extreme forms for several years to come. But the impact of extreme drought is felt within days,' said Elson.
She emphasised that water risk is present in every sector and asset class. 'It's not just about thinking about what [water scarcity] means for the agricultural industry, but also what happens to countries heavily dependent on hydroelectric power generation,' Elsdon said, highlighting that two of the largest water reservoirs in the US are at risk of not having enough water to produce electricity.
The International Food Policy Research Institute suggests that current business-as-usual water management practices and water productivity will put 45% of the projected 2050 global GDP ($63tn) at risk as water insecurity could slow or halt production, lead to reputational damage, or leave assets in water-stressed regions stranded.
A CDP study from 2022 showed that 69% of listed equities are exposed to water-related risks that could result in a substantive change in their business, and that $15.5bn is already stranded, or at risk of being so, as a result of the global water crisis.
Urgent action points
Included in the letter are several recommendations for governments, including strengthening national sustainable development strategies for 2030 ahead of the UN Water Conference to 'ensure a planned and equitable transition to a water-secure world by 2030 or sooner'.
The coalition also wants to see governments commit to ambitious short-term water targets that outline a pathway for each water-dependent sector, as well as creating new domestic policies to deliver on the targets.
Leaders are urged to incentivise private investments in water solutions through efficient mechanisms for pricing water risks and impacts, removing environmentally harmful subsidies by set deadlines, and developing just transition plans for affected workers and communities.
'To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 and its sub-targets, we must work together to ensure that people around the world have access to water and sanitation, and we must improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimising the release of hazardous chemicals and materials.
'We must halve the proportion of untreated waste water and substantially increase water recycling and safe reuse globally.
'Water use for agricultural, industrial and energy generation activities must be transformed, to reduce demand and ensure that productive activities do not exacerbate water scarcity conditions,' the letter stated.
The letter also calls for mandatory water disclosure requirements aligned with international best practice recommendations, including Target 15 of the Global Biodiversity Framework developed at COP15.
'While data availability has improved in recent years, implementing mandatory water disclosure and strengthening strategies, in particular regarding water security and access, is crucial for our investments decisions and engagement strategy,' said BNP Paribas AM's Herskovich.
CDP's Elsdon said that companies need to disclosure not only how they impact water availability, but also how water scarcity impacts them.
'Understanding where they are on their journey, how they're aligning their business to make sure that they don't end up with stranded assets and possibly bankrupted by the issue. And secondly, so that they're actually leading the pack and future-proofing their business.
'I think a lot of companies aren't ready for that. But that doesn't mean that can be the status quo. We can see every year global droughts are intensifying, and the risk to life is also intensifying. So we don't really have 5-10 years to comfortably get used to the subject, we have to treat this like the crisis that it is.
'And so, we need to see some mass capacity building amongst companies and help them understand why disclosure isn't just a box-ticking exercise but really, the key to unlocking future growth and, in many cases, companies' existence. Without it, we could see some material downside for a lot of companies,' said Elsdon.

2023-02-06,a2407996,JO Hambro's Lowen: Avoid defensive stocks on 'ludicrous' valuations,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,John Schaffer,"James Lowen says names like Diageo and GSK are over-valued, but suggests there is too much doom and gloom on the UK economy.","James Lowen, manager of JO Hambro's PS1.6bn UK Equity Income
fund, believes the British market is more tilted towards defensive stocks than at any time in the last 50 years as investors have become overly risk-averse.
Lowen identified seven defensive stocks that he sees as making up a disproportionate size within the FTSE 100 - namely, Diageo, Relx, GSK, AstraZeneca, Unilever, British American Tobacco, and Reckitt Benckiser.
He suggested that these names were trading at 'ludicrous' valuations, and that beyond defensive areas 'most stocks have more than 75% upside to prudently calculated target prices'.
Another indicator of attractive valuations is the level of share buybacks in the UK market. Lowen said that around half the companies within the portfolio, which he runs with Clive Beagles, have been buying back shares in recent months.
Sectors the portfolio manager is particularly bullish on include energy and financial services firms.
BP, the top holding in the fund at 6.4%, saw its share price rise by more than 28% in the year to the end of January. Despite this, Lowen believes the oil major remains good value.
'BP has a free cash flow yield of 20-25%. It pays for itself in four years,' he told Citywire Wealth Manager.
Elsewhere, financials make up the bulk of the fund's top 10 holdings, with banks Barclays (4.1%) and NatWest (3.7%) standing alongside insurers Legal & General (3.6%), Aviva (3.4%) and Phoenix Group (3.3%).
'Banks had a noose around their necks for 20 years with interest rates falling. Now that's going the other way,' Lowen said.
He argued that blue chip UK banks should all be trading on more than book value, as they are making returns on capital in excess of 10%.
Barclays' shares are trading at 0.56x book value, according to Refinitiv data, while the equivalent figure for NatWest is 0.85x.
Lowen noted that a more recent increase in UK banks' share prices means they have been trimming positions, as they are regularly breaching the fund's 300 basis point (bps) active limit.
'I have three banks currently at the max 300 bps position. Every day I'm having to sell, as the shares are going up,' he said.
Barclays is one holding enjoying a resurgence. Over 12 months the stock is down 5.6%, with most of the pain being felt in the first half of 2022. But during January, the shares rose nearly 14%.
The JOHCM UK Equity Income fund overall lost 1.4% during 2022, less severe than the average 3.1% loss in its Citywire sector. The fund is up 2.7% over three years versus 0.2% for the sector, winning Beagles and Lowen + ratings.
In a quarterly update for the fund, the duo touted that the strategy's dividend yield was 'close to its highest ever', with the 2023 yield on the fund forecast to be around 5.7%Last week, the IMF forecast that the UK would be the only G7 economy to shrink this year. However, Lowen argued that the pessimism around the British economy was too high.
Too much doom and gloom on UK
The fund manager suggested that low unemployment and PS200bn of pent-up savings built up during the Covid-19 pandemic meant that a more severe recession was unlikely. That positivity extends to Lowen's forecasts for the companies in his portfolio.
'This is different from 2008/09 - 85% of the fund is on [the] front foot. I'm looking forward to most trading updates in the fund,' he said.
As a result, the managers have some consumer discretionary names in the mix, such as furniture retailer DFS and car dealership Lookers.
At the end of January, DFS' share price was down more than 37% over a year, but Lowen believes the business will be resilient where its competitors have gone bankrupt or are severely struggling.
'DFS dominates as 40% of all sofas are bought there. Not many retailers have that market share,' he said.
On Lookers, which has seen a less severe 8% drop in its share price over a year, Lowen suggested that there was significant pent-up demand for used cars due to supply-side shortages.
The fund manager suggested that Lookers' shares are trading below the value of its property holdings and cash on its balance sheet.
'I'm paying 75p in the pound for its property and cash, even if it doesn't make anything this year, and it's set to make PS60m in 2023,' he said.
Lowen also has a small 1.9% allocation to real estate in the portfolio, and was adamant that housebuilders should not be written off.
'Housebuilders are as cheap as the first month of Covid, as cheap as after the Brexit vote, and as cheap as after the GFC (global financial crisis),' he said.
'During the GFC the mortgage market shut and all these companies had massive debt piles. Now they have massive amounts of cash.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/jo-hambro-s-lowen-avoid-defensive-stocks-on-ludicrous-valuations/a2407996,19

Rainback, who assumed the role this month, has been with EFG AM since joining as a fund analyst in summer 2020. Prior to that he had held similar roles at Allfunds Bank and Aviva Investors.
In addition, Rainback had also been featured in Citywire Selector's 40 under 40, where he was included in the class of 2020/21. Linked to that, he also spoke to Citywire Selector about the challenges of being an effective selector during the work-from-home requirements of the pandemic.
Rainback's move comes as Andrew Harradine shifts to become a director of research at the group. The former Citywire Selector cover star, who joined EFG AM in 2010, had been head of mutual fund selection and latterly global head of fund research.
It is understood Harradine's new role within the chief investment office will coincide with a slight restructuring of its fixed income and equities research.

2023-02-06,a2408468,Flexibility and opportunism are key to navigating volatility,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Krystle Higgins,"Invesco fixed income manager Stuart Edwards explains why investment grade credit is a 'sweet spot' for bond managers, and why he is seizing opportunities when he sees them.","Bond market valuations look more attractive than ever but an active investment approach is crucial, according to Invesco's Stuart Edwards, who said his short-term tactical approach is to remain nimble.
Edwards, who is Citywire +rated, oversees a range of fixed income funds, including the Invesco Tactical Bond UK strategy which allows the team to invest up to 100% of its net assets in cash, cash equivalents, short-term debt securities and money-market instruments, depending on market conditions.
'Tactically we have taken some of the risk off, and are trying to manage the market volatility by being nimble and flexible and taking the opportunities where we see them,' said Edwards.
'Additionally, I have taken the interest rate exposure of the fund down because of this big rally in markets, the recent bounce in bond market valuations, as well as yields having fallen in recent months.'
Edwards' comments come after the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage last Wednesday - a move taken by the markets as being dovish, despite the current rate of 4.5-4.7% being the highest since September 2007.
Bonds finally pay
Edwards said his message to clients is that bond markets finally look attractive.
'We are now in a world where fixed income offers much better absolute value, and would possibly give better relative value compared with other asset classes as well. If you are looking at bonds versus dividend yields, they quite clearly offer a viable alternative to other asset classes in the current market environment.'
Historically investors have been forced to take higher risks in order to achieve desired returns, said Edwards, whereas now bond yields are a lot more attractive and are paying off, which, he argues, are more in line with the risks you are taking.
Investment sweet spot
For Edwards, the tactical bond fund has given him and his team a more flexible mandate in terms of how much risk they can take, and he thinks the best current value is currently found in investment grade credit.
'If we are being super cautious or conservative, we could invest mostly in cash or cash proxies, and then on the other extreme, if we were being bullish we could really tilt the funds towards credit and other more risk-oriented markets.
'Even though you could argue that economic risks are increasing, not least because of the higher interest rates that companies are having to contend with. We think that in a sense, investment grade credit has been a bit of a sweet spot.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/flexibility-and-opportunism-are-key-to-navigating-volatility/a2408468,3

2023-02-06,a2408373,Why these bond PMs expect ESG debt to become increasingly niche in 2023,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,"The ESG-labelled debt market is likely to see more niche opportunities targeting biodiversity and social housing because of the cost of living crisis and COP15, say investors.","Granular, biodiversity-related bonds are set to become one of the biggest trends in ESG-labelled debt in 2023, according to sustainable fixed income investors speaking to Citywire Selector.
Stephen Liberatore, head of ESG and impact at Nuveen's global fixed income team, expects an increase in bond issuance relating to wildlife and biodiversity.
'Renewable energy is always going to be at the forefront simply because we need to transition away from fossil fuels. But my expectation is that we're going to see more specific things like wildlife and conservation and biodiversity investments,' he said.
Having recently featured as a speaker at two Davos events covering biodiversity investing, Liberatore said the topic has gone mainstream and there is a general interest in utilising and understanding how to apply the green bond structure to biodiversity outcomes.
Liberatore expects to see more niche blue bond issuance tackling specific biodiversity-related issues coming to the market.
'They're going to take a variety of different forms - from coral reef restoration to transitioning fisheries away from using fishing nets and targeting the lower end of the food chain to longline fishing focusing on higher value-added fish.
'There's also going to be projects that transition smaller countries' wastewater treatment plants from simply dumping the waste into the ocean into actually implementing like wastewater treatment plants,' said Liberatore.
A similar observation was made by Mitch Reznick, head of sustainable fixed income at Federated Hermes.
'Because of the commitments for climate change and biodiversity at COP26 and COP27, I think you'll see an even more niche market evolve.
'There's a growing recognition that sustainability factors like climate change, biodiversity are very much linked and not siloed, and I think maybe we'll see some recognition of that in these securities - blue bonds, nature bonds, things like that,' he said.
Debt-for-nature swaps
Jana Harvey, senior portfolio manager in RBC BlueBay Asset Management's emerging markets team, said several developing countries, such as Cabo Verde, Ecuador and Sri Lanka, are now eyeing debt-for-nature swaps (DNS).
This is a form of debt restructuring aimed at redirecting public spending toward nature and environmental protection.
Belize achieved a record-breaking DNS in 2021, where the country restructured $364m of commercial debt to create around $180m of sustainable financing for conservation.
The DNS, which reduced Belize's debt by 12% of GDP, also resulted in a commitment from the country to protect 30% of its ocean, in addition to a range of other conservation measures.
Harvey also expects more innovative solutions this year to help emerging markets fund the cost of climate mitigation and adaptation, which comes despite the current hostile market environment for high yield names and helps build on the momentum from COP27.
'Within the high yield space, the Maldives is expected to return to the green bond market, while Gabon is expected to launch its first international green bond this year to fund the construction of hydroelectric plants.
'Indonesia followed the example of South Africa by announcing yet another Just Energy Transition Partnership at the G20 summit, helping the country to mobilise $20bn over the next three to five years to accelerate a just energy transition.
'We expect other countries to follow,' said Harvey.
Similarly, Saida Eggerstedt, head of sustainable credits at Schroders, expects a lot of ESG-labelled debt opportunities in Asia in 2023.
'Asia is lagging behind the rest of the world in decarbonisation, but there has been some interest from companies to issue green bonds and sustainability-linked bonds for the first time,' she said.
Eggerstedt pointed to auto and technology companies in China and Korea as two interesting plays.
Asian tech companies are generally very big, as they tend to export globally, and have huge energy needs to run their large-scale data grids.
This, Eggerstedt said, means there is a huge opportunity for green bond or sustainability-linked bond issuance related to renewable energy investments.
'These are sectors where there is transparency because they have to deal with the Western world, and so they have standards and [transparent] supply chains.
'China as a country has issues related to freedom, and so when we buy something, we will probably look at a company like Lenovo, which is exporting everywhere in the world and is familiar with Western investors.'
Social in focus
In addition to biodiversity, Liberatore expects social bond issuance, which experienced a dip in 2022, to increase this year because of the cost of living crisis.
'What we're hearing on the social side is a lot more discussion and concerns around housing affordability and access to affordable housing globally.
'Now, if the general market consensus that we're going to have some form of recession takes hold, there's going to be more issuance from that perspective,' he added.
Eggerstedt said social bond issuance is also likely to pick up in Asia related to affordable housing or other types of public infrastructure such as metro stations or public transportation.",https://citywireselector.com/news/why-these-bond-pms-expect-esg-debt-to-become-increasingly-niche-in-2023/a2408373,4

The main index was down 0.61%, or 47 points, at 7,853 after a deterioration in Sino-US relations as US fighter jets were sent to take down a suspected Chinese spy balloon over the coast of South Carolina.
Susannah Streeter, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the move had 'dashed hopes that rapprochement between Washington and China could be achieved' and caused a slide in the Hang Seng in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite.
'There is a chance that this could be a short-lived wobble given that the US State Department appears to have kept the diplomatic doors open, suggesting a planned visit to China by US state secretary Antony Blinken could happen as soon as conditions allow,' said Streeter.
Also causing unease was Friday's US employment data, which showed the world's largest economy had added 500,000 jobs last month, a sign of strength that could encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates in its battle against inflation. The recent rally has been propelled by hopes that after reducing its latest hike to 0.25% last week, the Fed would let interest rates peak in the summer.
Asia-focused insurer Prudential (PRU) was the biggest faller, losing 3.1%, or 43p, at PS13.11. It was followed by real estate investment trust (Reit) Segro (SGRO) as investors feared further tightening of monetary policy, which has been centred around increasing the cost of borrowing; shares were down 2.7%, or 24p, at 861p.
Investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown (HL) slid 2.7%, or 26p, to 923p after Credit Suisse cut its recommendation from 'neutral' to 'underperform' and lowered the target price from 900p to 800p, although this was offset slightly by Deutsche Bank increasing its target price from 920p to 990p after the group last week announced it had taken a stake in RetailBook, a venture that allows ordinary investors to take part in corporate floats and share sales.
The FTSE 250 ticked 0.9%, or 186 points, lower to 20,406, led by molten metal flow engineer Vesuvius (VSVS), which dropped 5.2%, or 22p, to 396p after being hit by a cyber attack. The company said it shut down the systems affected and is working with cybersecurity experts to identify the extent of the issue, including the impact on production.
Asos (ASC) slid 4.9%, or 47p, at 915p after analysts at Deutsche Bank downgraded the fast-fashion platform to 'hold'.

The group announced her departure on Monday alongside the nomination of a new executive board.
The board will include Christophe Baviere and William Kadouch-Chassaing as chairmen, as well as Sophie Flak and Olivier Millet. They will be responsible for developing the group's third-party asset management business and improving its financial and non-financial performance.
Baviere, who is founding chairman of Idinvest Partners, which merged with Eurazeo in 2018, has been a member of the executive board since 2021.
Kadouch-Chassaing joined the board in March 2022 and has been serving as general director finance and strategy and chief investment officer.
Flak, who is the managing partner in charge of ESG and digital joined the firm in 2013. Meanwhile Millet has been a member of the executive board since 2018.
Eurazeo said the positions of chairman of the board of directors and CEO will be rotated annually, with Baviere and Kadouch-Chassaing taking up the positions, respectively.
Morgon will also stop being a member of Eurazeo's executive board. In addition, general secretary Nicolas Huet and Marc Frappier, who is head of the mid-large buyout investment division, will also leave the business at the end of April.
'I leave my position after 14 years at the helm of Eurazeo with huge pride in the successful transformation of the Group, which has become one of the major leaders in Private Equity in Europe. A successful group that has experienced double-digit growth over the last five years. A Group that has become global, present in 10 countries,' Morgon said.
Jean-Charles Decaux, president of the supervisory board, added: 'With the appointment of a new, collegial, and focused executive board... the board has sought to instil a new dynamic to accelerate the development of Eurazeo's activities and to deploy a high-performance strategy creating value for the benefit of all its stakeholders.
'The supervisory board has full confidence in the new executive board, which brings together complementary and experienced profiles and skills to amplify Eurazeo's transformation and make the company become a major player in asset management in Europe by relying on the diversity of all the talents of its teams.'

Funds at the Edinburgh-based asset manager fell by a record PS113bn to PS223bn over the 12 months to 31 December, the steepest fall on record, according to a report by the FT citing figures from the firm.
The fall was mainly driven by a fall in the value of the partnership's investments - tilted towards US technology stocks, which suffered heavily in 2022 - with net client outflows accounting for just PS20bn, or 18%, of the loss in assets.
It came as the Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted towards the US technology sector, also fell by around a third last year, while the S&P 500 fell by more than 19%.
This followed a steep sell-off early last year, promoted by a turn towards hawkishness on inflation by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks, ending the flood of new money which had propelled the valuation of growth stocks upwards for more than a decade.
Alongside government stimulus during the coronavirus crisis, which saw the group's assets grow by more than PS100bn over the course of 2020, the favourable environment for growth drove assets at Baillie Gifford from PS22bn at the end of 2000 to PS336bn at the end of 2021.
Portfolio managers at the firm have sought to reassure investors that their search for the small number of long-term extraordinary growth stocks such as Amazon and Tesla will recover.
Last month the portfolio managers of Baillie Gifford US Growth (USA ), an investment trust whose shares soared over 133% in 2020 but have more than halved in the past 12 months, told investors: 'We understand that weak performance is challenging for shareholders to endure but we can assure you that we remain confident in, and committed to, our approach.'

Some big numbers stand out - US equities for instance don't look cheap at 17.8x forecast earnings, whereas the rest of the world excluding the US seems a bargain at 12.37x 2023 earnings forecasts.
Japan is very cheap at 12.68x 2023 earnings with a forecast 7.5% growth in earnings per share, as is the UK. Digging down to national markets the valuation anomalies looked even more marked. Pretty much all the other developed world nations look cheaper than the US, some by a country mile.
Ireland for instance stands out. It trades at 11.90x earnings on a likely 20.64% increase in earnings per share in 2023. In the developing world, cheap markets abound. I would highlight Brazil at 7.12x 2023 numbers, Turkey at 6.25x 23 earnings and Poland on 7.69x earnings.

View from the Cape
Meb Faber, a highly respected US analyst and fund manager at Cambria Funds, looked at a more traditional measure of 'value' - the cyclically adjusted price to earnings or Cape ratio popularised by economist Robert Shiller.
Faber runs the numbers on a quarterly basis for a full range of developed and emerging markets in the MSCI database. The Cape measure is a more long-term measure of value and irons out the various business cycles to look at what constitutes longer-term value. As expected, the US looked terribly expensive at 27x earnings (only Danish and Indian equities were more expensive), while pretty much everywhere else was cheaper, with UK stocks at 14x earnings.
Faber then added other fundamental measures such as price to book, cashflow and dividends and worked out a composite score. On this measure, the US was, as you'd expect again, very expensive while Poland sat at the top with Hong Kong, China and Spain not far behind. The UK came some way down but was still above average in score.
US tech still expensive
One of the reasons why so many investment 'experts' reckon that US stocks are so expensive is because of the large technology names dominating its major benchmarks. They all had a torrid time in 2022 and their impact on US equity markets overall was huge.
SocGen analysts report that: 'At one point towards the end of 2020, they [the FAANGs] contributed 10% points to annual S&P 500 index performance. Last year, they gave a lot back, deducting almost 800bp from the S&P 500, compared to 1,100bp for the rest of the index.'
Yet despite the big price declines in 2022, many of the big tech names are still eye-wateringly expensive. If we use consensus forecast numbers for 2023 as a yardstick, Alphabet still trades at 22.8x earnings, with likely earnings per share declines of 2.8% in 2023. Apple is at 24.7x forecast earnings although analysts are still pencilling a 1% increase in earnings. Microsoft is 28x forecast earnings, Netflix at 32x forecast earnings and chip giant Nvidia at 66x earnings. So, it's not an exaggeration to say that US big tech is still expensive.
But do US investors care? No.
As of the end of last week, the S&P 500 had gained 8.9% since the new year while leading tech stocks soared: Nvidia up 48%, Netflix 24%, Amazon 34%, Meta Platforms 56% and Alphabet 22%. Apple and Microsoft were up 'only' 16% and 10% by comparison.
Looking at the S&P 500, on most technical measures US equities are on a tear. Since the recent low of 3,782 at the end of December, US large-cap equities have advanced by more than 10%.
But if we use a slightly older low - possibly the trough - of 12 October 2022, where the S&P 500 hit 3,579, then we are just under 17% ahead. Tangentially, the S&P 500 is now above both its 200- and 20-day moving average and most technical measures look supportive.
Investors are clearly excited by the prospect that the US Federal Reserve is slowing down the pace of its interest rate increases. There's also the prospect that inflation is slowly coming down.
Grim US earnings
But there's an obvious headwind to reckon with. US corporate earnings look a tad sickly. Back to those SG analysts again and their most recent updates on the current US corporate earnings cycle, most of which are fairly grim.
At the end of January, they reported: '60 of the S&P 500 firms have reported on fourth quarter 2022 earnings per share with the net number of EPS beats at the lowest level since 2017. The number is also lacklustre for top-line [sales growth] with lowest net beats since 2019. Margin pressure [is also] evident with net profit margins falling for six straight quarters, Q4 2022 at 11.4% vs the peak at 13% in Q1 2021.'
The French bank's models still 'suggest negative EPS growth for the first three quarters of 2023', and SG is probably as close as you can get to the 'consensus' on Wall Street.
Global flows
So, what's going on? I would offer up three observations. The first is based on global liquidity and money circulating in the financial system. Research house CrossBorder Capital monitors global liquidity flows, which are often carefully managed by central banks. Its datasets suggest that we've seen a substantial in flow of capital at the global level, with China, post zero-Covid, leading the way.
CrossBorder reports that: 'In December 2022 and January 2023, the People's Bank of China added a whopping near-Y=3tn (US$440bn) to China's money markets, or some three times what they injected in total over the preceding two years!'
All that extra liquidity needs to find a home and some of it eventually ends up in the US.
And one of the reasons why so much of this liquidity ends up in US equity markets is because US corporates are so damned profitable, even after allowing for the recent inflationary pulse. A few weeks ago the excellent subscription-only Sunday Briefing ran a fascinating chart which shows that across most major industries, 'most of the world's profits end up in the USA'.
Its extraordinary graphic shows the top three countries' share of profits by sector - given that the US markets represent 'only' between 60 and 70% of the developed world stock markets market value, one could make the case that US equities are still underweight the real economic power of the US.
My last observation is that the rest of the world, and especially the UK, is still cheap, especially after the recent US rally and arguably getting cheaper on a relative basis by the day. US stocks might have a great first quarter in 2023 but there's still plenty to play for in the rest of the year.

2023-02-07,a2408629,Hargreaves flags value concerns on five funds as returns worsen,Sustained underperformance,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Christopher Johnson,"The PS1.8bn HL UK Income is among five portfolios flagged as needing 'additional focus', while another four funds have been cited over specific performance issues.","Funds supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown (HL) has said five of its funds require 'additional focus to deliver value'.
In the group's third value assessment report, the HL Multi-Manager High Income , Multi-Manager Income and Growth
(now HL UK Income), Multi-Manager UK Growth , Multi-Manager Strategic Assets
and Multi-Manager Balanced Managed
funds were placed on a watchlist. The board stopped short of declaring them bad value for money overall.
The number of funds requiring improvement has increased from last year, when only three funds were flagged.
The move comes as Hargreaves' fund management expansion drive gears up despite criticisms over the chequered records of portfolios it already runs.
Last month's launch of three multi-asset strategies followed the unveiling of the HL US fund late last year.
Multiple factors are considered in the value assessments, with Hargreaves flagging issues with investment performance, specifically, across much of its existing range.
Four funds were rated red for delivering returns that do 'not represent value', while another five were earmarked for 'continued focus', meaning nine out of the group's 14 funds, or 64% of the range, were deemed to have performance issues to some degree.
'Investment performance across our multi-manager fund range, with some exceptions, needs further improvement,' said John Misselbrook, chair of Hargreaves Lansdown Fund Managers, a subsidiary of the FTSE 100 parent company.
Notably, the PS151m Multi-Manager Strategic Assets fund was flagged once again for requiring overall improvement and given a red performance rating. It returned 1.1% over the three years to December 2022 versus the sector average of 5.6%.
The fund, co-managed by Thomas Wells and David Smith, has suffered PS7.7m in outflows over a year, according to Morningstar data.
The HL Multi-Manager Income and Growth (now HL UK Income) fund - the largest fund flagged as a concern with PS1.8bn of assets - lost 10.1% over the year to September 2022 versus its benchmark's drop of 8.7%.
The fund, managed by Richard Troue and Ellen Powley, has seen the highest outflows of all the strategies flagged, at PS127m over one year, according to Morningstar.
The report said a focus on higher-yielding UK companies had been a long-term headwind, but pointed to a change of approach during the period, a transition to using segregated mandates, and further changes expected this year to reduce sensitivity to market rotations.
In common with all the underperforming funds, the strategy is also expected to benefit from new hires and processes. Chief investment officer Lee Gardhouse noted the hire of an additional fund manager and two analysts during the period, with Ziad Gergi recently promoted to multi-manager head.
The HL Multi-Manager Balanced Managed Trust fared better, with the report rating its performance as amber, despite a painful overweight to hard-hit mid-cap growth equities.
The PS855m fund, managed by Gergi and Smith, returned 1.6% over the three years to December 2022, falling short of the peer benchmark, which returned 6.9%.
The portfolio was flagged as requiring continued focus overall as 'the fund's [ongoing service charge] was found to be marginally higher than its peers' over the period under review'. The report stated that the use of segregated mandates is expected to bring charges down in line with the peer group this year.
The HL Multi-Manager High Income fund was assessed as offering value in 2021, but now requires 'additional focus'.
In its report, Hargreaves Lansdown said the fund's performance did not deliver value to investors on a total return basis, with the strategy still reeling from the impact of the pandemic and the subsequent global economic shutdown.
Over the three years to December 2022, it lost 2.7% versus the sector average return of 5.6%.
The PS159m HL Multi-Manager UK Growth fund, also marked amber, suffered the worst absolute performance out of all the funds. Over the year to September 2022, it dropped 17.4% versus the sector average loss of 15.6%.
In addition, over the three years to December 2022, it lost 5.7%, while the benchmark was down 0.4%. According to Morningstar, the fund was hit by PS9.8m in outflows over one year.
The report states that the fund's structure allows for a higher allocation to managers with 'significant flexibility' in their portfolio. But this meant the fund had greater exposure to smaller companies that suffered during last year's market volatility.
The FCA introduced annual value assessment reports in 2019, forcing asset managers to determine whether their funds are delivering value on key metrics such as costs and returns. However, the reports have been criticised for their lack of independence and the lack of changes made as a result.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/hargreaves-flags-value-concerns-on-five-funds-as-returns-worsen/a2408629,12

Joining from Candriam where they were in charge of merger arbitrage strategy, Cretin-Fumeron and Dieudonne will bolster the asset manager's bid to meet the growing demands of clients looking to diversify away from traditional asset classes into those offering low volatility, uncorrelated sources of returns with experienced risk management.
A Carmignac spokesperson said: 'The two managers benefit from a public consecutive 18-year track record managing this strategy together, first at ADI in 2004, then OFI Investment Asset Management in 2009 and then Candriam in 2018.'
Carmignac also intends to launch two merger arbitrage funds in the first half of 2023 with different volatilities managed by the duo, targeting professional investors.
Additionally, Carmignac announced the appointment of Jean-Francois Louvrier, as a portfolio manager.
In his new role, Louvrier will work to build an Article 8 global equity fund which will integrate environmental and social criteria within the investment process. Carmignac aims to launch the fund in summer 2023.
Carmignac has been expanding its alternative capabilities for the last few years.
Maxime Carmignac, managing director of Carmignac UK including ultimate responsibility for strategic product development, said: 'We set high long-term ambitions for our alternative range and are delighted to welcome Cretin-Fumeron and Dieudonne to our team.

2023-02-07,a2408626,Why celebrity CEOs are a corporate governance risk,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,Investors need to pay more attention to ensure governance controls are in place in companies with celebrity business leaders such as Elon Musk.,"Investors need to consider 'the cult of celebrity CEOs' as a governance issue, according to the chief executive officer and co-founder of the Corporate Governance Institute, David Duffy.
Speaking to Citywire Selector, Duffy said asset managers are 'throwing big lumps of money' into companies with high-profile leaders, without making sure there are sufficient governance controls in place to ensure their investments are well spent.
'Celebrity CEOs have their own personal brand. The big problem for a board of directors is if the CEO's personal brand becomes bigger than the company's personal brand,' said Duffy.
Nowhere is this more noticeable than at Tesla, where Elon Musk's aura has 'allowed the investing masses to ascribe a far greater premium to Tesla than was deserved on fundamentals', according to GAM's Mark Hawtin.
Over the past year, however, Musk's eccentric public persona hasn't exactly benefitted his company the way it once did, and investors have become increasingly concerned over Tesla's governance issues.
This was evident at the company's annual meeting last year, where stewardship experts speaking to Citywire Selector were shocked over the 'frat-boy atmosphere' and the 'disrespectful' way in which shareholder concerns were met.
Musk's subsequent takeover of social media platform Twitter, where he fired the board of directors and appointed himself as its sole member within his first week as chief executive, has done little to calm investor fears.
Duffy highlighted that Musk has shown poor governance standards since he started Tesla, where he initially served as both chair and CEO. 'He doesn't want to answer to anybody, really,' he added.
Similarly, Mirabaud Equity Research tech analyst head Neil Campling told Citywire in response to Tesla potentially buying a stake in Glencore that 'the way Musk conducts his stewardship of Tesla (to a large extent through social media) should already have ESG funds wondering about the G in ESG'.
Unwillingness to 'conform to the standard governance model', Duffy said, is noticeable among other celebrity CEOs such as Theranos and FTX's respective founders, Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Bankman-Fried.
'CEOs like Elon Musk or Elizabeth Holmes don't like governance, because then they're held to account,' said Duffy. 'But the problem of being a celebrity CEO is that the more you push yourself forward, the more public scrutiny you're gonna get. That's what celebrity CEOs don't like, at all.'
He added that celebrity CEOs tend to exercise a high degree of control over their company, which becomes particularly challenging for investors looking to engage.
'Where you've got a celebrity CEO who has a dominant position in the company, they're gonna be very hard to control.
'If the CEOs don't own much stock, it's easier [for investors to influence the company]. If they own lots of stock, it's more difficult. Musk has a 13.4% stake in Tesla, making him the largest shareholder.
'BlackRock, Fidelity, Bailey Gifford and other Tesla investors... could want to remove Musk as CEO, or bring in a stronger board, if he doesn't abide by their ESG requirements?
'The challenge of the board is to control the CEO. In this case: how much time is Musk actually spending on Tesla? Is it a day a week, a half day a week? Does the board even know how much time he's spending? Probably not. I don't think he's filling in timesheets,' said Duffy.
Beware the male, pale and frail
Treating the cult of celebrity CEOs as a governance risk means investors should ensure there is a strong and engaged board in place, but also ensure board members possess the kind of subject knowledge needed to critically examine the company - for instance, having scientists as board members of medtech companies.
'Elizabeth Holmes had really good people on her board, but they're all what I would call ""male, pale and frail"". They were all over a certain age and there wasn't one scientist on her board, who could challenge her.
'I believe that was deliberate, so that they wouldn't dig down and figure out that the blood testing was just a sham,' said Duffy.
For ESG conscious asset managers, it also means ensuring there is a representation of sustainability experts present on the board who can challenge the CEO on sustainability issues.
Asset managers should also place greater emphasis on the separation of power, as it is common for US company CEOs to also serve as chairs. 'That's not a good arrangement to have - how can the CEO report to himself as the chair? It's mad,' said Duffy.
He also emphasised that investors need to make sure there is a succession plan in place for celebrity CEOs - something which, when a CEO's image becomes representative of the company at large, is not always easy to find.
'Shareholders want to invest in the longevity of a company - what they don't want to happen is that the CEO goes and the company share price tanks, and there's no good successor in place,' said Duffy. 'If I was on the board of Tesla, I'd be making sure it had somebody internally who was ready to take over.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/why-celebrity-ceos-are-a-corporate-governance-risk/a2408626,3

BP, which followed rival Shell (SHEL) in reporting a doubling of profits last year, jumped 3.9%, or 18p, to 497p, after unveiling 2022 profits of PS23bn thanks to surging oil and gas prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Shell, which reported profits of PS33bn last week, was 0.7% firmer at PS24.16.
This helped propel the blue-chip index 0.4%, or 31 points, higher at 7,868 but still below Friday's 7,902 all-time high.
Sentiment was also cheered by Halifax reporting house prices had stabilised in January after two months of falls as homebuyers were spooked by rising interest rates. The typical UK property now costs PS281,684 but the rate of annual growth slowed to 1.9% from 2.1% in December, showing buyers remain concerned about affordability.
Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said potential buyers have been holding off in the hope the market will 'cool further this year and mortgage rates will ease off'.
Rates are expected to rise again in the short term but Scholar said 'looking further ahead, the central bank could pause on interest rates or even cut rates later this year, which could help support the housing market, particularly if the economic downturn reveals itself to be less aggressive than previously feared'.
Lenders HSBC (HSBA) and Lloyds (LLOY) were both up, adding 1% and 0.8%, to trade at 602p and 53p, respectively.
The FTSE 250 was down 0.18%, or 36 points, at 20,372, led lower by Morgan Advanced Materials (MGAM), which shed 6.8%, or 21p, to trade at 294p after the ceramics manufacturer warned its profits will be 10-15% below expectations due to a cybersecurity incident in January. The group said a number of sites had seen delays in production due to the cyberattack.
Food manufacturing group Bakkavor (BAKK) was down 2.5%, or 3p, at 116p after HSBC cuts its recommendation from 'hold' to 'reduce'.
Iron ore miner Ferrexpo (FXPO), whose activities are concentrated in Ukraine, slipped 2.3%, or 3p, to 148p, after it was notified by a court order to freeze the bank accounts of its largest subsidiary in Ukraine as part of an investigation into potential underpayment of iron ore royalty between 2018 and 2021. The group has denied all accusations and said it will appeal the decision.
In investment trust news, PRS Reit (PRSR ) gained 2.9% to 92.3p from a 23% discount after the developer of family homes for rent said its net asset value edged 0.6% higher in the second half of last year.

Plagued by decades of corporate governance issues, the Asian country has been avoided by many foreign investors.
But Kamil Dimmich, who manages the Pacific North of South Emerging Markets All Cap Equity fund , says it is one of his favourite markets to invest in.
Dimmich's fund holds more than 70 investments across 30 different emerging markets.
When asked which country was his favourite, Dimmich said he 'loves' Korea, a country which he believes offers great value and is tackling its long-standing issues.
'The government's really getting in on the act. For a while they've had this ambition of moving Korea out of its kind of market pariah status,' he told Citywire Selector.
'They're trying to get Korea promoted to being a developed market. Korea is a developed country, it's a democracy and it's a lot wealthier than a lot of markets that are supposedly developed. Living standards are high, infrastructure is incredible. But it's an emerging market in the financial world because the financial market has all these legacy issues.
'This includes things like convertibility of the currency, difficulty in having an account to trade Korean stocks and Korean companies not wanting to speak in English.'
Investment paradox
Dimmich said that these issues coupled with a lack of reward for investors have made Korea an investment 'paradox' over the years.
'It's a market where the companies are hugely profitable. People like Samsung, Hyundai and Kia are selling very high-end global exports. But they have among the lowest returns on equity as a market. How's that possible? It's because they completely mismanage their capital.'
He said that the root of this was Korean companies being traditionally owned by inefficient family-run conglomerates called chaebols.
'The chaebols all own stakes in each other and in things like unprofitable construction businesses or infrastructure projects. There's been an almost crazy mismanagement of capital over the years.
'But for a while now there's been a trend to address capital efficiency. It's slowly improving. Banks have been a great example. Going back some decades, their chaebols were building unprofitable shipyards and other things. When there was an economic downturn, they all went bust and there was a banking crisis.
'Fast forward to a few years ago, the banks have addressed all these issues. Many have been merged or restructured, the regulator has become very strict on capital ratios. Lending became very conservative.'
Dividends at last
Dimmich said the really good news for investors was that as reform momentum builds, Korean companies were becoming increasingly interested in shareholder rewards.
'They have started paying dividends. They have introduced formal progressive dividend policies, where they have this target of paying out 30% of their net income as dividends. Some of them are now doing share buybacks.
'Some Korean companies are operating at a 70% to 80% discount to their book value. They have increased profits due to better management and streamlining.
'And as they're getting more profitable and because their valuations are so low, even if they're only paying 25% of their earnings, dividend yields are really high. You're getting an 7% or 8% dividend, which was unheard of.'
Dimmich said in a way his team was 'dreading' corporate reform in Korea as it could spell the end of a period where his team have worked through the country's difficult environment to seize opportunities.
'We love Korea. As value investors it's been a great market for us,' he said.
'The changes are not going to happen for a number of years. Hopefully in the process there will be an opportunity to make a lot of money out of Korea as some of the huge valuation discounts start narrowing.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/why-we-love-investing-in-south-korea-even-if-no-one-else-does/a2408616,2

'I very much believe that diverse teams make better decisions. I've seen that both as an investor in previous roles and now as a business leader,' said Smits who took on the CEO role at the $1.8tn manager in 2020.
The 30% Club started out in the UK in 2010, when just 12% of FTSE 100 board directors were women. The 30% female representation was achieved in 2019, with women now making up 40% of boards, but there are still only eight female CEOs at FTSE 100 companies.
The campaign now has over 20 chapters, including in Hong Kong, Australia, Japan and Malaysia.
In Hong Kong, the percentage of female board members at companies listed on the Hang Seng index stood at 16.4% last year, compared with 13.9% in 2019. Meanwhile, female representation on Malaysia's top 100 publicly-listed boards rose from 24% in 2018 to 28.2% last year.
Australia hit the 30% mark in 2020 on the boards of its largest companies, and was at 32.1% last year.
Nevertheless, Smits said: 'We're not at 30% around the world. Remember, the 30% number is not a ceiling. It's a floor.'
Asserting your right to lead
Smits started her career at Pantheon Ventures, before joining Adams Street where she eventually took on the role of chief investment officer. At both firms, she was recruited by a female partner. She later became chief executive of Newton Investment Management, one of BNY Mellon IM's investment firms.
'Maybe there was some unconscious bias in that that I ended up in organisations where there were already some powerful role models,' said Smits. 'What you do need to do as a woman, which I have learnt to do, you do also need to ask for it. If you just sit around and wait to be tapped on the shoulder, you're not going to get very far.'
Within the investment management industry, Smits pointed to Asia's higher percentage of female fund managers, citing Citywire's Alpha Female report. Last year, Taiwan led the way with 27% of fund managers being female, ahead of Hong Kong in second place with 24% and Singapore in fifth place on 20%. That compares with the global average of 12%.
One area of improvement for the industry would be keeping female portfolio managers in the workforce and maintaining their track records even after career breaks, Smits said. An initiative she has championed to target that retention is the Diversity Project which helps female fund managers get career training.
BNY Mellon's board of directors has a 36% female representation, with 36% from underrepresented ethnic or racial backgrounds, the firm told Citywire Selector's sister site Citywire Asia today.

2023-02-07,a2408548,PE firm seeks PS300m to take British and Nordic small caps private,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Selin Bucak,UK-based investment firm Hanover Investors has raised PS150m so far for its third private equity fund.,"UK-based Hanover Investors has raised PS150m so far for its latest private equity fund that targets small-cap public markets.
The group's third fund is aiming to raise PS300m in total and is expected to have its final close by June. It will invest in companies in the UK and the Nordics, with a view to taking them private.
'The small-cap market is often overlooked but this also means that many companies have unrealised potential and are ripe for transformation,' said Matthew Peacock, founder and chairman of Hanover Investors.
'Despite - and indeed because of - the current economic headwinds, the opportunities today are greater than they were twenty years ago.'
The Hanover Investors Fund III fund will invest in six to seven companies with a significant portion of the capital dedicated to co-investments. In addition to take-private transactions, the fund will also make some traditional private equity investments.
Hanover's predecessor fund was split 60/40 between take-private and pure private transactions. However, senior partner Brett Lankester said that given the current value opportunity in public markets, the team would expect Fund III to have 70% of it allocated to take-private deals.
History of deals
Over the last six years, the firm has completed five take-private transactions in the UK and one in Sweden. These include the acquisition of software companies Brady Technologies and Kalibrate in the UK as well as Clearstar, which is now based in the US.
Lankester commented: 'The firm sources from the UK and Nordic public markets but this may include firms from the US or continental Europe.
'Clearstar is indeed a US company, but it was UK listed. One of the elements we look for is a significant valuation gap between a UK/Nordic listed entity and peers in its home market. As a listed company in the UK, Clearstar traded at a material discount to its US peers where the sector is better understood.'
Since launch in 2002, Hanover has achieved a 40% internal rate of return in its private equity strategy, according to Lankester. This includes the return on deals executed prior to the launch of its first fund in 2016.",https://citywireselector.com/news/pe-firm-seeks-300m-to-take-british-and-nordic-small-caps-private/a2408548,0

The Ucits-compliant GIB AM European Focus fund is focused largely on corporate culture as a defining factor when targeting long-term trends for European investments.
Kates will be supported by the boutique's head of equities, Neil Brown, and the boutique's wider global equities investment team.
Company documents indicate it is a Europe ex-UK fund, which is long-only and will invest in between 25-to-40 stocks, with a focus on mid- and large-cap stocks. It will be classified as Article 8 under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.
Commenting on the launch, Kates said: 'We believe long-run stock market returns are driven by a small number of exceptional companies. The fund seeks to identify these truly sustainable businesses and hold them over a significant timeframe, thereby enjoying the benefits of exponential growth.'
Katherine Garrett-Cox, CEO of GIB AM, added it has a unique emphasis on assessing company character, with specific focus on how they engage, motivate and develop their workforce as well as attitudes towards customers and wider stakeholders.
'This fund does exactly that, by looking for those companies that act and behave in the right manner, set high standards and strive to exceed them,' she added.",https://citywireselector.com/news/gib-am-targets-company-culture-with-new-european-equity-fund/a2408392,0
2023-02-07,a2408474,"Infrastructure and private debt will be 2023's alts breakout themes, says Preqin",Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ian Heath,"Energy transition, deglobalisation and investor desire for inflation hedges seen as headwinds for the two asset classes.","Infrastructure and private debt are expected to be the best-performing alternative asset classes this year, according to sector analysts Preqin.
Speaking at a roundtable event, Christoph Knaack, the firm's CEO, said infrastructure had a 'very strong 2022' and would continue to perform well this year.
'While we expect fundraising in 2023 to be slightly more challenging, there's some really important drivers to support continued strong performance in infrastructure, one being for instance the accelerated energy transition that we are seeing.
'This is especially in Europe as we are striving towards more energy independence,' he said.
'Nearshoring is also a topic and deglobalisation is coming to the forefront. We see various examples of chip manufacturers nearshoring in the US and also in Europe. In a lot of cases, private capital will have to step in and help with that funding.'
Knaack said another tailwind in this area was the passing of the US Inflation Reduction Act, which will see heightened investment into domestic clean energy projects.
Preqin research identified last year as 'exceptional' for fundraising in infrastructure, particularly in North America where $79.9bn of the $171.8bn global total was raised.
Private debt potential
Knaack said private debt should also perform well this year due to its potential as an inflation hedge. 'In this uncertain environment of high inflation, people are looking for an inflation hedge to some extent and the floating rate nature of a lot of what we see in private debt is naturally an inflation hedge.
'As an asset class it is still quite early in its maturation in many geographies, especially in the Asia Pacific. We do expect, especially over 2027, that asset class to start maturing, as banks continue to retrench and private capital steps in.'
Dave Lowery, Preqin's head of research insights, said there had been 'big demand' in particular for short duration private debt.
'The fact that many private debt investments are floating rate means that they can take advantage of rising interest rates, and they don't necessarily suffer in the same way as long duration fixed income investments.
'We saw relatively solid fundraising in private debt in 2022. We expect that to continue into this year as well.'
Preqin research indicated that investors were 'bullish' on private debt with 37% expecting stronger performance this year.
Lowery said natural resources could also be an 'interesting' asset class this year as commodity prices could increase. 'A lot will depend on China's domestic activity and what that means both for commodities and markets more broadly.
'The flip side of that is if you've got any raw materials needs, for example if you're in a private equity firm, it could mean higher input costs. But I think demand for commodities is still likely to be going up to 2023.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/infrastructure-and-private-debt-will-be-2023-s-alts-breakout-themes-says-preqin/a2408474,0

The Brookfield Infrastructure Income fund has been launched in Europe and Asia Pacific and will offer periodic liquidity to clients.
To do this it will have a dedicated allocation to public infrastructure debt securities, which will be managed by the firm's public securities arm.
The strategy is available to clients of Brookfield Oaktree Wealth Solutions business, which was established as a partnership between Brookfield and Oaktree in 2021. The group now offers a number of liquid, semi-liquid and private strategies to financial advisers.
'We believe the key characteristics of infrastructure assets can provide investors several benefits across market cycles including stable income, capital appreciation, low volatility, a hedge against inflation and rising interest rates, and diversification,' said Chloe Berry, head of the Brookfield Infrastructure Income strategy.
'Brookfield continues to see a robust pipeline of infrastructure investment opportunities and believes the addition of this asset class to an investor's portfolio may provide resiliency and inflation protection in today's environment.'
According to the fund's UK key information documents, the strategy's operating costs and management fees add up to 1.42% per year. There is no carried interest, but there is a 0.70% performance fee that will be charged if the investment outperforms certain criteria.
Redemptions are expected to be offered each quarter, with shares held less than one year having to pay a redemption fee of 2% of the proceeds due to each shareholder.",https://citywireselector.com/news/brookfield-launches-infrastructure-strategy-for-private-wealth-clients/a2408525,0

Brazier will step down on 31 March, handing responsibility for the PS1.1bn Ninety One UK Alpha
fund to Anna Farmbrough, who has co-managed the strategy since July 2022. UK Equity Income
fund manager Ben Needham will join her on the fund.
In the three years to the end of December, the UK Alpha fund underperformed its peers in the Citywire UK (All Companies) sector in difficult market conditions, losing 6.6% against a sector average loss of 0.4%.
Net outflows amounted to PS1.4bn over the three years, according to Morningstar data.
Brazier (pictured) started his career with Schroders and joined Ninety One (then Investec) from Threadneedle in 2014.
'Simon has been with us for eight years and made a significant contribution to the growth of our Quality team,' said a Ninety One spokesperson.
'[He] wants to take some time to consider the next step in his career. We are very grateful to Simon and wish him all the best.'
Farmborough and Needham will also co-manage the Ninety One UK Equity Income
fund.
The pair have worked closely with Brazier since joining the Quality team in 2014.
Ninety One said there would be no changes following Brazier's exit to the Quality process, which targets attractively valued companies with competitive advantages, disciplined capital allocation and sustainable cash flows.
'[Farmborough and Needham] have significant experience in UK equities, and we are excited about the opportunity for the UK Alpha and UK Equity Income funds under their joint leadership,' the spokesperson said.
'Given the depth of expertise, strength of leadership across the Quality team, and the disciplined investment process, we expect a seamless transition.'
Brazier's exit comes around a year after Citywire revealed UK Equity fund manager Dan Hanbury had left River and Mercantile to rejoin Ninety One.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/uk-alpha-manager-brazier-to-leave-ninety-one/a2409025,7
2023-02-07,a2408544,Investors miss record-breaking FTSE as UK outflows mount,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jeremy Gordon,Investors have continued their relentless flight from UK equities since the start of this year even as the FTSE 100 has hit an all-time high.,"Investors have continued their relentless flight from UK equities since the start of this year, even as the FTSE 100 has hit an all-time high.
UK investors pulled a net PS868m from open-ended funds focused on their home market last month, according to Calastone. January marked the third-worst month on record, paired with the bleak milestone of 20 consecutive months of outflows.
Since Calastone started tracking flows in 2015, investors have sold PS7.3bn of UK-focused funds and bought PS58bn of international funds, as a long-term unwinding of home bias has combined with enduring pessimism on the British market.
Calastone's head of global markets, Edward Glyn, said UK equities had gone from being a core holding for global investors to occupying a 'dusty and diminished corner' of portfolios.
'UK shares have now seemingly lost their allure for domestic savers as well. The combination of January's near record high for the UK market with near-record outflows smacks of opportunistic selling against a backdrop of chronic pessimism,' he said.
While political instability has played a role, poor sentiment is significantly due to the preponderance of cyclical sectors like oil and commodities in the FTSE, as well as slower-growth areas like banking, tobacco and pharmaceuticals.
Ironically, those same 'old economy' areas have helped generate a recent uptick in performance.
The FTSE 100 pushed above 7,900 on Friday last week, eclipsing its previous peak in May 2018.
The UK blue-chip index became the best performing major developed market benchmark last year, as giant energy-sector constituents Shell and BP both delivered in the region of 50% returns including dividends.
Even after the recent bounce, however, longer-term performance remains lacklustre.
In the 20 years to last Friday, the FTSE 100 was up just 114% at a headline level, according to Morningstar. With the importance of income in the UK market, the total return including dividends has been a stronger 350%, though that still pales in comparison with the increasingly dominant American market.
Over two decades, the S&P 500 has delivered an 867% return for sterling investors with dividends reinvested (551% without) as the MSCI World has returned 623%.
Global winners, bonds bright spot
As the UK exodus continued in January, the 'big winners' have been global portfolios, said Calastone, which tallies the monthly flows figures from the two-thirds of transactions by UK investors which take place on its network.
Investors have bought into the ongoing rally which started in October, adding a net PS969m to global equity funds in January.
In a significant shift, global funds without an ESG mandate won just under half of those net inflows - one of only two months out of the last twelve where they held up so well relative to sustainable funds.
Fixed income funds also enjoyed a very strong January, as investors added PS1.2bn to the asset class. That was the second largest net inflow to bond funds on record.
Over the last 12 months, inflows to bond mandates have totalled PS3.8bn as yields have risen to more attractive levels. Equity mandates have shed a net PS6.6bn over the same period.
Glyn said the 'best yields in over a decade' were clearly tempting investors, as well as more dovish comments from central banks raising hopes that the global rate-tightening cycle is closing to its peak.
'The bond funds most in favour in January were tilted to the higher quality end of the market - sovereign or investment grade corporate debt - suggesting investors are content to sidestep riskier high-yield corporate bonds at present,' he added.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/investors-miss-record-breaking-ftse-as-uk-outflows-mount/a2408544,2
2023-02-08,a2408733,Who is the alts group now holding 5% of GAM stock?,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,"Filings indicate an emerging market-focused direct lending firm has taken the opportunity to top up its bets, but who is it?","Global Emerging Markets (GEM) may be a slightly generic name for an investment firm, but the little-known investment house could emerge as quite important for the future of GAM.
The New York-headquartered alternative investment group increased its bet on the Swiss asset manager earlier this month. It raised its 3.13% stake to 5% through its Luxembourg-domiciled GEM Global Yield fund, according to Swiss Stock Exchange filings from 3 February.
Reuters approached GEM for comment regarding this additional exposure last week but lead manager and GEM founder Chris Brown remained tight-lipped.
He said he would not comment on an individual position beyond saying he would not seek a board seat. However, the firm did link to the Reuters write-up on its official website.
The increase in GEM's allocation comes hot on the heels of Jorg Bantleon further reducing his own GAM bet. He dropped his allocation below the 5% threshold, which led to a market update being publicised.
This is the second time in three months that the German investor has reduced his position, having gone from an 11.3% holding in October 2022 to a 4.24% investment today.
GEM's increased allocation also comes in the wake of GAM issuing a profit warning amid projected losses of $336m and revealing its annual results for 2022 would be delayed by two months. This led to the group's share price falling 10% to CHF 0.92 (EUR0.93) on 26 January; it currently sits at CHF 0.90.
GEM, however, was undeterred and appeared to increase its investment at the time of share weakness.
So, who is GEM? The group is a direct lending specialist with about $3.4bn in assets under management. It is the second-largest external investor in GAM after Silchester International Investments, which retains the 15% holding it acquired in 2014, according to the latest register document.
GEM's predominant focus has been on emerging markets - hence the name - but other recent investments include French luxury brand L'Officiel, which it sold out of in 2022, and a $100m capital commitment to AI-powered real estate technology group ReAlpha in December.
The company's literature indicates it has completed more than 570 transactions in 72 countries, which have mainly centred on small to mid-cap management buyouts, private investments in public equities, known as Pipes, and select venture investments.

2023-02-08,a2408745,Why Adani does not spell doom for India's family-owned firms,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,"FSSA's Vinay Agarwal believes the country is still home to some of the best family-run companies, despite conglomerate Adani's crisis.","The crisis surrounding the Adani Group has raised concerns about the company's long-term viability and has also led to questions about governance in Indian equities, most notably within family-led organisations.
Vinay Agarwal, who runs the FSSA Indian Subcontinent
fund among a host of other Asia-focused equity strategies at FSSA Investment Managers, believes Gautam Adani's crumbling empire is not representative of how family-led Indian companies operate.
'I invest in family-owned Indian conglomerates as they tend to take a long-term view of the business, which is different from other commercially run businesses, which tend to have three- to five-year time horizons, or even quarterly ambitions,' Agarwal told Citywire Selector.
'Even private equity-run companies tend to be shorter term than family-owned companies, so it makes sense to think about time horizons. With regards to India, we are actually dealing with some of the best-quality, family-run businesses globally. A lot of the companies are run on a more transparent basis, without the glass ceilings that come with some family-run companies.'
Agarwal has never held Adani Group but stopped marginally short of saying he never would. He said the current crisis, which unfolded following a two-year investigation by short-seller Hindenburg Research, highlights how poorly run groups can be masked by the wider environment.
'There was always a sense in the Indian market that there was something not quite right. It is good it has come to light now and not further down the line, as this prevents it from being a major, systemic challenge for the wider Indian equity community.
'There are likely to be some ancillary businesses and maybe some regional banks that come under pressure as a result, but the challenge is relatively contained. Even prior to the Hindenburg Research publication, the valuation of a lot of the non-core businesses didn't look right.'
For Agarwal, Adani represents an outlier in regard to corporate governance, which he said has improved markedly during his career.
'I have been investing in Indian equities for 20 years and the Asia Pacific market for 10, and governance has improved markedly over that period. The chances of something like Adani happening two decades ago - or going undetected - were higher. Now there is a clearer focus on governance and transparency.'
The largest positions in Agarwal's $309m FSSA Indian Subcontinent fund are currently a 9.8% allocation to banking group HDFC, a 6.0% exposure to Colgate-Palmolive (India), and a 5.9% investment in ICICI Bank.
Kotak-Mahindra Bank, which is still run by founder Uday Kotak, is the fourth largest exposure at 5.9%. Meanwhile, Mahindra Forgings, a components manufacturer established and run by the Mahindra family, lies fifth in terms of largest bets for Agarwal, as it is a 4.9% allocation.
How do family-focused funds fare?
There are a number of investment vehicles that target family-owned stocks as a theme. These strategies - distinct from the more demographic idea of family-related investment ideas - focus on companies that have family ownership, which is viewed as providing clarity around succession and long-term planning.
Focusing on the more prominent strategies, which feature allusion to a family-owned focus in their names, the European Small & Medium Companies sector appears to be home to a number of these specific funds within the Ucits-compliant universe.
Among the top performers is a recently reworked vehicle. Credit Suisse overhauled an existing small- and mid-cap European equity strategy at the end of 2020 to become the CS (Lux) European Entrepreneur Equity fund. The tweak to lead manager Jan Berg's strategy has paid off, as it now ranks 40th in its 256-strong peer group over the three years to the end of December, having returned 16.5% in euro terms.
Among the most prominent positions in the fund are French luxury group LVHM - a 3.85% position, according to the fund's December factsheet - financials firm KBC Group (3.46%), and French marketing group Ipsos (3.1%). LVMH is run by the Arnault family, KBC is centralised among a small number of core shareholders, and Ipsos was established by its current CEO, Didier Truchot, in 1975.
Elsewhere, The LO Funds Continental European Family Leaders
has also performed adequately, delivering a 9.3% return over three years against the sector average of 3.7%. It shares zero crossover with the Credit Suisse fund in terms of largest positions.
The single largest investment is a 2.5% allocation to cosmetics group Intercos. The group was established by Dario Ferrari in 1972 and is run through his family holdings group Dafe. He sold a minority stake to the Singapore sovereign wealth fund at the end of 2020.
A long-running strategy in the family-owned universe is the Bellevue Entrepreneur European Small-cap
fund, which is overseen by Citywire + rated Birgitte Olsen. it sits 102 out of 256 strategies, having returned 5.6% over the three years to the end of December.
Her allocations are different again, with science and technology giant Merck as the single biggest investment. Despite going public in 1995, the Merck family still retains around 70% of the company as a whole. Olsen has a 3.5% allocation in her fund.
The Pictet-Family
fund, which also has exposure to LVHM, has not fared as well as others mentioned here. Cyril Benier and Alain Caffort's fund currently lies 242 out of 256 in the European small- and mid-cap equity sector, having lost 14.1% in euro terms over the same three-year period.
Elsewhere, Carmignac's Family Governed
fund sits within the wider Equity - Global Blend universe and is currently posting top-quartile returns. It has delivered 14% in US dollar terms on a three-year, absolute return basis, which compares with the sector average fund performance of 4.5%.",https://citywireselector.com/news/why-adani-does-not-spell-doom-for-india-s-family-owned-firms/a2408745,11
2023-02-08,a2408746,New framework launched to assess climate risk in sovereign bond issuers,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,"The ASCOR framework will assess sovereign issuers on emission pathways, climate policies, and mitigation, adaptation and climate goals financing needs.","Sovereign debt universe is an outlier when compared to other asset classes in that it has not had an internationally agreed framework for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities.
This could soon change, as an asset manager and owner coalition, which has $5tn in assets, has launched a new framework for incorporating financially material climate change information in sovereign bond assessments.
The Assessing Sovereign Climate-Related Opportunities and Risks (ASCOR) project will result in an independent, free and publicly available assessment tool intended to help investors engage with issuers to 'find a common understanding of the transition at a national level, as well as giving the opportunity to sovereigns to showcase their progress in addressing climate change'.
It also aims to drive the financing of mitigation, adaptation and the just transition, especially in countries that are least able to finance it themselves.
The framework is built on three pillars:
Emission pathways, which considers historical emission trends and the alignment of forward-looking emission reduction targets with international climate goals;
Climate policies, which considers national policy making efforts to mitigate emissions, adapt to climate change, and ensure a just transition;
Consideration of opportunities to finance a country's mitigation, adaptation and climate goals, which is particularly important given countries most vulnerable to climate change have insufficient financing for the green transition.
Victoria Barron, ASCOR co-chair and head of sustainable investment at BT Pension Scheme Management, said the current 'analysis dearth' - where investors do not how information on the climate risks and opportunities of sovereigns and issuers are unsure on what information investors want - leads to 'unfair extrapolations or missed investment opportunities'.
'By translating the complexity of climate risk assessment into clear, assessable metrics that tie to long-term economic drivers, ASCOR is putting climate change at the heart of sovereign investment decision-making,' said Barron.
Udo Riese - co-lead of UN-convened Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance's monitoring, reporting and verification track (2020-2022), member of the ASCOR Steering Committee, and head of sustainable investing at Allianz Investment Management SE - said the results of the ASCOR project will have a significant impact on investors' capital allocation in the mid- to long-term.
'Sovereigns' decisions on climate change are central for the just transition and for limiting temperature rise to 1.5degC. To make informed decisions on sovereign debt, investors require transparency and comparability on climate-related actions of sovereigns.
'Results of the ASCOR project deliver on this by providing information spanning from sovereigns' Nationally Determined Contribution and their energy policies to fairness considerations between developed and developing countries,' Riese added.
Early stages
At this stage, ASCOR is inviting key stakeholders to provide feedback until 31 March.
The project will conduct assessments of an initial 25 countries over the second and third quarter of the year and share results with sovereign issuer representatives for feedback, and the final report will be published in Q4.
Included in the pilot assessment are several developed markets such as Australia, Germany and the United States, as well as emerging markets including Brazil, China and India. Kyrgyzstan, Kenya, Barbados and Thailand also feature on the list.
Together, the 25 pilot countries are estimated to cover nearly 70% of global greenhouse gas emission, and represent over 80% of both the FTSE World Government Bond Index and Bloomberg Global Treasure Index.
Founders of ASCOR include the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA), Ceres, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), and Sura Asset Management, which are part of the project's steering committee.
Amundi, Franklin Templeton, Ninety One and MFS Investment Management are some among the asset managers on the project's advisory committee.",https://citywireselector.com/news/new-framework-launched-to-assess-climate-risk-in-sovereign-bond-issuers/a2408746,0

The venture capital investment platform is now eyeing expansion to Germany, the Nordics and the UK.","Venture capital investment platform Carbon Equity, which focuses on climate tech, is launching its second portfolio fund targeting EUR75m to EUR100m in capital after the close of its first vehicle.
The Climate Tech Portfolio Fund I raised EUR42m from more than 200 investors and was 60% oversubscribed. This takes the total amount Carbon Equity raised in its first year of operations to in excess of EUR90m across 400 investors.
Co-founder and CEO Jacqueline van den Ende said the Amsterdam-based company will now be doubling down on international expansion and raising Series A funding.
She told Citywire that the platform will launch this year in Germany and the Nordics, and is aiming to expand to the UK early in 2024. In addition, the firm will be launching integrations with wealth managers.
Carbon Equity, launched in mid-2021, offers individual investors access to funds tackling the world's environmental problems. Currently investors can access it with a minimum investment of EUR100,000 , which will be soon reduced to EUR50,000.
The fund will invest alongside climate venture capital and private equity managers, such as 2150, Energy Impact Partners and Astanor Ventures, in a diversified portfolio of climate tech start-ups and scale-ups.
According to HolonIQ, climate tech companies attracted more than $70bn globally in 2022, recording an increase of 89% year-on-year.
'In the decade ahead, demand for carbon-free alternatives from consumers, companies and governments will drive a major wave of innovation across all sectors,' commented van den Ende. 'Investing in a Carbon Equity fund offers the opportunity to put your capital to work with significant climate impact and attractive financial returns.
'By empowering millions of investors with access to unparalleled climate investing opportunities, Carbon Equity aims to mobilise billions in private capital toward much needed climate solutions,' she added.",https://citywireselector.com/news/climate-tech-platform-targets-up-to-100m-for-second-fund/a2408736,1

The firm's head of the Americas will take over his role.,"Invesco CEO Marty Flanagan will step down on June 30, with Andrew Schlossberg set to take over, the $1.4tn Atlanta-based asset management firm said on Wednesday.
Flanagan, who has been CEO of Invesco since 2005, will also leave Invesco's board in June. He will serve as chairman emeritus through 2024.
Schlossberg, who joined Invesco in 2001 and serves as senior managing director and head of the Americas, will become president and CEO in Flanagan's stead.
'Andrew has a long and established track record of delivering a superior investment experience to clients, helping employees grow in their careers, and leading innovation and profitable expansion across our global business,' said G Richard Wagoner, Invesco's board chair, in a statement.
'His leadership in the asset management industry and wide-ranging experience at Invesco position him well to bring next-generation leadership to the company and deliver for all our stakeholders.'
Wagoner praised Flanagan for his 'strong leadership' and for overseeing a $1tn increase in AUM during his tenure, adding: 'The board and I are extremely appreciative of Marty's many significant achievements during his 18 years at Invesco, which will have an enduring impact on the firm's long-term success.'
Doug Sharp will take over as head of Americas, adding this purview to his role as head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He will also have 'global responsibility for ETFs, SMAs and digital capabilities,' the company said.

2023-02-08,a2408727,FTSE peaks again after Powell predicts 'significant' inflation fall,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Michelle Mcgagh,US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell lifts markets with comments indicating the central bank may ease off on its interest rate rises this summer.,"The FTSE 100 has hit an all-time high after markets detected a 'dovish' stance in comments by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell last night.
The UK's main stock market index jumped 0.8%%, or 62 points, to 7,926, beating the peak set on Friday after recovering from a wobble on Monday caused by the release of stronger-than-expected US employment data showing the addition of 517,000 new jobs last month.
In a speech, Powell repeated the central bank's view that inflation had begun to fall but added that the surprisingly strong jobs figures showed the battle against rising prices will 'take quite a bit of time'.
Powell said interest rates may need to push higher than expected if economic conditions remain strong, but said this year should mark 'significant declines in inflation'.
After last month's smaller 0.25 percentage point rise in the Fed's funds to a range of 4.5%-4.75%, markets are hoping the central bank will end its aggressive rate rises with two more 0.25 percentage point moves, although there is a risk it could do more.
'Concerns that last Friday's bumper jobs report would see the Fed react to what it perceived as an overheating labour market were eased, with Powell's relatively relaxed response possibly reflecting the seasonal anomalies that often affect the January numbers,' said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
'Whether Powell will remain so relaxed if the next set of payroll figures are similarly elevated is open to question, and investors will be keeping a close eye on next week's US inflation figures for January. If there is any sign of a renewed uptick in prices, the market would likely respond very negatively.'
Investor sentiment was also boosted by economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) predicting the UK would avoid a recession this year, although it cut its forecast for GDP growth this year to 0.2% from 0.7%.
Sterling jumped 0.5% to $1.2105 against the dollar, while gilt yields slipped across all maturities.
Susannah Streeter, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'The forecast from NIESR is more bullish than the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, suggesting the economy will suffer a period of stagnation rather than back-to-back quarters of contraction,' she said.
BP (BP) led the blue-chip index for a second day, up 3.2%, or 16p, at 532p following yesterday's record profits from the oil giant.
JD Sports (JD) added 2.9%, or 5p, to 184p after confirming the divestment of its UK non-core fashion brands, which it sold to Sports Direct owner Frasers (FRAS), which was up 2.1%, or 16p, at 801p.
Barratt Developments (BDEV) gained 1.8% to 468p after delivering 6.9% growth in home completions in 2022 despite a slowdown in activity in the past six months.
Charlie Huggins, head of equities at Wealth Club, said the 'picture is not looking as grim as it was back in the autumn' for housebuilders and there is 'a sense that interest rates are close to peaking'.

The global equity team, except for the Global Technology
fund, is becoming part of the global fundamental team with immediate effect. Global Technology is moving to the global innovation team.
The global fundamental team is headed by James de Uphaugh, while the managers who are moving across from the global equity team will report to Tom Record.
Record joined Liontrust (LIO) last April as part of its acquisition of Majedie Asset Management.
At Majedie, Record managed equities for eight years, co-heading the Majedie Global Equity and Global Focus funds. He was previously a fund manager at Baillie Gifford.
The consolidation of the teams comes after Liontrust's Income
and US Opportunities funds were moved from the global equity team to the global fundamental team last July. The Income fund, formerly managed by Geffen, was placed under Chris Field.
At the same time, the firm created the global innovation team, led by James Dowey and Storm Uru. The pair previously worked under Geffen at Neptune Investment Management.
The Liontrust global equity team was formed in 2019, when the firm bought Neptune, which Geffen (pictured above) founded and led as CEO.

2023-02-08,a2408706,Jupiter sells Starling and bans unlisted stocks,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jeremy Gordon,Struggling fund group finally sells its stake in unlisted digital bank Starling and rules its open-ended funds will no longer invest in private companies.,"Jupiter has managed to sell its stake in unlisted digital bank Starling and vowed its open-ended funds will no longer invest in private companies.
The deal will see the position in Starling sold to multiple existing shareholders and is set to close in the coming weeks, according to a letter from the fund group's chief executive Matthew Beesley to clients.
The fund firm's promise not to invest in private companies comes after volatility and outflows last year delivered a fresh reminder of the liquidity issues.
The majority of Jupiter's Starling stake has been held in its PS1bn UK Mid Cap
fund, where it was a 6.5% position at the end of January. The portfolio's weighting to hard-to-trade private businesses had repeatedly neared the 10% limit set by the regulator last year.
The buyers include Chrysalis, the closed-end fund also run by UK Mid Cap's manager Richard Watts but, as an investment company with its own board, is technically a third-party buyer.
The listed fund, which focuses on fast-growing private businesses looking to float, announced late yesterday afternoon that it had agreed to buy PS20m of equity in Starling. The transaction will raise Chrysalis
from a 12% to 15% position, the second biggest in the portfolio.
Fellow backers of the digital bank include Goldman Sachs and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. It is not clear which other existing shareholders are participating in the deal.
At the same time as the sale, Jupiter announced a change in policy to stop its daily-dealing funds from investing in unquoted stocks.
'As a result of the sustained market volatility we have experienced in recent years it is ... clear to us that investor sentiment towards holding unlisted assets in open-ended funds has changed,' said Beesley (pictured).
He said Jupiter's open-ended funds would not make any new investments in the asset class. 'While we do still retain very small stakes in a minimal number of other unlisted assets, we will prudently manage these exposures over time with a view to generating maximum value for our client.'
These positions include a small holding in Secret Escapes in the UK Mid Cap fund.
Other prominent Jupiter funds which have held Starling include Dan Nickols' PS623m UK Smaller Companies
fund.
Jupiter will be hoping the Starling sale and subsequent policy change draw a line under a saga that, on top of illiquidity concerns, has also drawn scrutiny over the interplay between Chrysalis and open-ended funds run by the same UK smaller companies desk. Those concerns have included the divergent valuations at which vehicles have held Starling as well as a furore over performance fees and cross-holdings.
The implied valuation at which Jupiter has offloaded its stake in Starling is unclear. Talks over a deal were first reported in August.
The digital bank, which is profitable month-on-month, was previously valued at around PS2.5bn in a funding round last April.
Jupiter's UK Mid Cap fund sold some of its position at that time. However, the portfolio's total weighting to unquoted stocks still hit 8.1% at the end of May on the back of investor outflows and sharp losses for the rest of the public equity portfolio.
The valuation of Starling across the open-ended funds has since been written down multiple times in response to market conditions.
Purchases of the UK Mid Cap fund were recently suspended on Fidelity's retail investor platform.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/jupiter-sells-starling-and-bans-unlisted-stocks/a2408706,11

fund alongside the existing manager, Citywire + rated Jason Pidcock.
Pidcock has run the fund since its inception in March 2016. The Asian Income strategy has returned 21.6% over three years, outperforming a sector average of 9.5%.
Konrad joined Jupiter in October last year, after 17 years with UBS working in equity sales. He started his investment career at UBS in 2005, specialising in Japanese equity sales, before broadening to Asian equity sales four years later.
In 2018, Konrad was promoted to head of middle market advisory sales.
Pidcock said: 'With 17 years of experience, he has been able to hit the ground running and has already added significant value to our investment process.
'His knowledge of the region is excellent and we are excited about the prospects for our strategy.'
Last month Jupiter said it would merge the PS46.5m Asian fund into the PS1.2bn Asian Income fund due to their similar investment objectives and risk profiles.
The proposed merger is the latest move in Jupiter's consolidation project, which followed reports that the asset manager would be merging or closing a third of its 100-strong fund range.

The French group is looking to expand its stable of investment firms, having announced deals for Amilton Asset Management in 2019 and Meeschaert Asset Management in 2021. These firms were later merged into a combined entity.
In a press statement regarding the potential Mandarine deal, LFPI said: 'This merger project was born from the complementarity of the listed asset management activities of the LFPI group, through its subsidiary Meeschaert, and Mandarine Gestion. It plans to maintain all of the teams and expertise as well as the Mandarine brand.'
It is understood the addition of Mandarine is seen as a building block within LFPI's multi-boutique platform ambitions. It would diversify its existing offering and also expands its ESG/SRI capabilities, the group said.
Mandarine Gestion was created in 2008 by Marc Renaud and currently has EUR3.2bn in assets under management and more than 40 employees.
The deal would potentially involve LFPI Group assuming the 15% stake currently held by insurance giant Arkea IS, which it has held since 2017. Arkea has allocated EUR850m to Mandarine since assuming its position, but this could be redirected to its other subsidiaries, namely Federal Finance Gestion and Schelcher Prince Gestion.
LFPI Group operates across Europe and has EUR25bn in assets under management. Its activities revolve around four business lines: private equity, real estate, asset management, private management and family office. The group has nearly 400 employees operating in more than 10 offices located in Europe, the United States and Asia.",https://citywireselector.com/news/independent-asset-manager-enters-talks-to-buy-mandarine/a2408715,1

2023-02-09,a2408964,Crux's Markson-Brown: Why Adani's pitch didn't fool me,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Christopher Johnson,The former Baillie Gifford Pacific Horizon portfolio manager says his suspicions surrounding the Indian conglomerate's meteoric rise grew after the firm pitched to him last year.,"Crux Asset Management's Ewan Markson-Brown was unsurprised when the foundations of Indian billionaire Gautam Adani's business empire took a hammering last month.
For the manager of the PS123m Crux Asia ex-Japan
fund, a former Baillie Gifford manager of Pacific Horizon (PHI ) investment trust, the writing was on the wall for a long time. Long-standing lessons led him to steer clear of an investment that seemed too good to be true.
A $100bn collapse in the value of the conglomerate's seven listed businesses last month followed a report from New York-based short-selling house Hindenburg Research that accused Adani Group of 'brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud'.
Fierce denials from the group's namesake founder (pictured below) arguing the report was a 'calculated attack on the growth story and ambition of India' have yet to revive its fortunes.
Markson-Brown, who joined Crux from Baillie Gifford in June 2021, had been suspicious of the group's meteoric rise for some time, prompting him to take a sceptical view of an investment pitch he was given late last year.
'The management did come in a couple of months ago to talk about their new position,' he told Citywire Wealth Manager. 'They told us their present story about how they created the business over the last five years and how they had bought lots of interesting assets.
'That looked good on paper but in the early 2000s there were lots of infrastructure companies and they all blew up - and Adani was one of those. It has always been tarnished with that brush of not being one of the cleaner family groups in India.'
The Hindenburg report said Adani companies were highly leveraged, having pledged shares to access more loans. It had also previously been the subject of four government investigations into 'money laundering, stolen taxpayer funds and corruption' worth an alleged $17bn.
Markson-Brown does not believe the plunge in the value of the conglomerate's stock will have a detrimental impact on the Indian economy, but the reputational damage will take a while for the business and the country to wipe clean.
'In context, this is what happens in emerging markets,' he said. 'It has happened multiple times in India. But the question is: is there any chance Adani does not complete its projects? I think that is going to be slim.
'Adani was probably taking excess market share and had too much influence and power. The event may be a good thing because it will allow the market and especially government-led projects to be more open.
'The conglomerate was on the cusp of getting institutional money and once that happens the whole project would have been much bigger before eventually hitting the fan.'
Wealth manager view
Kamal Warraich, head of equity fund research at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, also avoided buying funds with exposure to Adani.
He said: 'The red flags included a high number of legal cases, related party transactions and Adani promoters being banned from the stock market in 2007.
'On the financial side, they have always been quite highly leveraged, as well as generating a large amount of revenue from fossil fuels like coal.'
Warraich believes corporate failings like these highlight the need for fund managers to prioritise high levels of governance.
'Unquestionably, the Adani case will put the spotlight on the quality of corporate governance and regulatory oversight in India. If the market regulator and central bank respond appropriately then it could limit the damage.'
However, the warning signs did not deter all professional investors. Jupiter Asset Management had proposed an investment in a $2.4bn share offering by Adani's Group, which was cancelled at the end of last month.
The firm declined to comment on its commitment to buy 0.16% of the share issue, valued at PS3.4m. It was the only UK-listed asset manager involved.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/crux-s-markson-brown-why-adani-s-pitch-didn-t-fool-me/a2408964,4
2023-02-09,a2408886,StanChart bid hopes lift FTSE to new high,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Michelle Mcgagh,FTSE 100 continues its climb as renewed bid interest from First Abu Dhabi Bank for Standard Chartered buoys blue chips.,"The FTSE 100 extended its record high after First Abu Dhabi Bank was reported to have revived its bid interest in Standard Chartered (STAN), with results lifting blue chips such as Unilever (ULVR) and AstraZeneca (AZN).
Asia-focused Standard Chartered leapt 7.3%, or 50p, to 739p after Bloomberg reported First Abu Dhabi was exploring a $30bn-$35bn cash bid, having briefly flagged then withdrawn its interest in early January.
This helped lift the main UK stock market index 0.6%, or 47 points, to 7,932.
Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca also provided upward momentum, rising 3.5%, or 382p, to PS111.34 after reporting a 25% rise in revenues to PS36.6bn in 2023. Boss Pascal Soriot said he expects 2023 to be another year of double-digit revenue growth.
Unilever edged 0.4%, or 17p, higher at PS41.17 after annual profits topped PS7.1bn due to higher prices for its well-known brands, which include Dove, Domestos, and Ben & Jerry's. Gains were stalled by the consumer giant's warning that there are further cost increases to come this year, despite a recent tempering in inflation.
Not all updates cheered the market, with British American Tobacco (BATS) falling 5.6%, or 175p, to PS29.15 after reporting a 7.7% rise in revenues to PS27.6bn and a 2.8% increase in operating profit to PS10.5bn. The tobacco giant confirmed it is on track to hit its PS5bn revenue target by 2025 thanks to a strong performance by its vaping division.
Entain (ENT) was the biggest faller, tumbling 9.6%, or 151p, to PS14.16 on news that US casino operator MGM had ended talks to take over the betting giant, with the boss of MGM stating the company had 'moved on'.
Susannah Streeter, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said UK stocks shrugged off renewed US interest rate worries thanks to the index's defensive nature.
'The defensive, international nature of the index has provided the seeds of growth, but an improved forecast for the UK economy this week is also adding fresh nutrients,' she said.
'There are hopes the forecasts could see fresh confidence emerge from consumers and limit the expected belt-tightening.'
The mid-cap FTSE 250 wasn't as buoyant as its large-cap peer, up just 14 points at 20,317, despite a strengthening pound, which usually helps the more domestic benchmark. Sterling gained 0.44% to $1.2124 against the dollar.
Darktrace (DARK) moved to the top of the index, gaining 3.4%, or 8p, to 250p despite the cybersecurity firm becoming the target of short sellers this week. New York-based activist investor QCM has published a report alleging flaws in the company's accounting and said it was 'deeply sceptical about the validity of Darktrace's financial statements'.
Ferrexpo (FXPO) also managed to claw back some losses, up 4%, or 5.5p, at 140.79p after the iron ore pellet miner saw accounts frozen for its Ukraine subsidiary over a royalty payment dispute.
Watches of Switzerland (WOSG) was a bleak spot on the mid-caps, tumbling 14.1%, or 142p, to 863p despite the luxury watch retailer reiterating full-year guidance following a jump in third-quarter revenues. The company said revenues rose 17% to PS407m versus the same quarter last year as the sales of luxury watches increased 22%.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/stanchart-bid-hopes-lift-ftse-to-new-high/a2408886,8
2023-02-09,a2409018,Nest and fund managers back climate change lawsuit against Shell,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,UK pension scheme Nest and several other European institutional investors back a ground-breaking legal claim against energy giant Shell for 'failing to move away from fossil fuels fast enough'.,"Danske Bank Asset Management, UK pension scheme Nest and several other European institutional investors are backing a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against energy giant Shell's board of directors for 'failing to move away from fossil fuels fast enough'.
The environmental law charity ClientEarth, which is a shareholder of Shell, filed a High Court derivative claim on Wednesday (8 February) stating the 11-strong board of directors had breached their duties to shareholders.
'Under UK company law, Shell's board has a legal duty to promote the success of the company and to act with reasonable care, skill and diligence,' ClientEarth said in a press statement. 'But we argue the board is breaching those requirements if it is not properly managing climate risk.'
ClientEarth argued that, while Shell said it has set Paris-aligned targets to become a net-zero emission energy business by 2050, 'its interim targets and strategy to get there simply don't add up' as research suggests Shell's strategy 'would, in fact, result in a reduction of just 5% in net emissions by the end of the decade'.
This was underscored by the Dutch court in 2021, which ordered Shell to cut its overall emissions by 45% by 2030 - a verdict that was appealed by Shell.
In the press statement, ClientEarth said Shell's current transition plans 'fail to deliver the reduction in emissions that is needed to keep global climate goals within reach and continue with fossil fuel production for decades to come'.
It added that this increases the risk for stranded assets as the world moves to renewable energy - something which, in turn, poses a significant financial risk for shareholders.
'Shell is seriously exposed to the risks of climate change, yet its climate plan is fundamentally flawed,' said Paul Benson, a senior lawyer at ClientEarth. 'In failing to properly prepare the company for the net-zero transition, Shell's board is increasing the company's vulnerability to climate risk, putting its long-term value in jeopardy.'
Shell's board said it will 'defend its position robustly', according to ClientEarth.
Among the institutional investors backing the case are the UK pension schemes Nest and London CIV, Swedish government pension fund AP3, Danish pension companies AP Pension and Danica Pension, as well as Danske Bank Asset Management. Together, these investors own 10 million shares in Shell.
'Investors want to see action in line with the risk climate change presents and will challenge those who aren't doing enough to transition their business,' said Mark Fawcett, CIO of Nest.
'We hope the whole energy industry sits up and takes notice. 2023 is a crucial year if we are to keep net-zero by 2050 on track and this case can be a springboard for Shell introducing key changes.'

2023-02-09,a2408818,"Social issues surged on 2022's proxy agenda, report finds",Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ian Heath,Morningstar's Lindsey Stewart explains which shareholder resolution trends are gaining traction at company AGMs as the firm releases its annual insight report.,"There was a 'steep increase' in the number of well-supported socially-focused shareholder resolutions in the US last year, according to Morningstar research.
The research giant's 'Proxy voting insights report for 2022' found that 241 key resolutions - those receiving 40% or more support - have been tabled in the last three years, with 102 of these lodged last year compared with roughly 70 in each of the two previous years.
The majority of 2022's key resolutions focused on social issues, with the three main themes being political influence/activity, workplace equity and civil rights/racial equity. Meanwhile, 55 related to environmental themes.
High-profile resolutions in the last three years have addressed oil giant ExxonMobil's net-zero strategy, worker treatment at retail group Amazon, civil rights at software firm Apple and platform misuse at social media conglomerate Meta.
Despite the uptick in the number of key resolutions, average support for such issues fell to 44% from a peak of 53% in 2021.
A number of large asset managers explained their support diminished because of an increase in resolutions that were 'lesser quality' or harmful to investors in the long term.
Lindsey Stewart, Morningstar's director of investment stewardship research, said there was an increasing trend of company directors being held to account through shareholder votes.
'Increasingly, asset managers are prepared to use their vote more against directors and not necessarily just on the shareholder approval side. There's been a pullback on support for what we consider ""prescriptive resolutions"",' he told Citywire Selector.
'They are prepared to vote against directors, if, for example, their engagement has failed on particular issues. They are holding the individual directors, that they see as responsible, accountable.'
Another trend he identified was more companies filing their own environmentally-focused resolutions.
'We've seen the climate theme move from purely shareholder proposals to management proposals as they start to set out their climate transition plans and submitting those to shareholder votes.'
Governance under scrutiny
Stewart said there had also been a renewal of interest in governance issues because of the challenging economic climate, which he expected to be a theme for 2023.
'Because we've seen this rare market where both bonds and stocks have fallen, we're again seeing a focus on the governance side of things, in a similar way to after the global financial crisis and the dotcom boom in the early 2000s.
'Once again, investors are focusing on governance structures, succession plans, management compensation, dual class shares and making sure that shareholders have rights commensurate with their economic stake.
'Things that got waved through during the good times are receiving a lot more focus, like making sure that there's quality management and there are checks and balances over power. I think that's going to carry through quite strongly into 2023.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/social-issues-surged-on-2022-s-proxy-agenda-report-finds/a2408818,0

Buchwald will take on the CEO role on 1 May, Russell said in a statement on Wednesday. Buchwald succeeds Michelle Seitz, who left the $277bn Seattle-based manager late last year to become the founder and CEO of MeydenVest Partners.
'Zach is expertly prepared to further the firm's innovation success - from cutting-edge asset allocation and unparalleled money manager insights to some of the earliest forays into factor exposures, and a competitively recognised implementation capability - to address the exacting demands of investors globally,' said Kate El-Hillow, president and CIO at Russell.

He also spent time leading BlackRock's financial institutional clients and also helped establish the firm's retirement solutions and financial markets advisory platforms. A theatre aficionado, he was also a producer of Hamilton, Fun Home and Girl from the North Country, according to a bio provided by Russell.
'I've long admired Russell Investments' unique legacy as a pioneer in investment consulting, OCIO [outsourced chief investment officer], portfolio implementation, and much more,' Buchwald said in a statement.
'Today's Russell is differentiated by its commitment to a total portfolio approach, which is critical in our interconnected investment universe. I am excited to work with this innovative team to help clients achieve their investment goals with the best possible toolkit.'
Russell was acquired in 2016 by TA Associates and Reverence Capital Partners, whose officials on Wednesday praised Buchwald as 'the ideal leader to further Russell Investments' legacy'.

2023-02-09,a2408888,Credit Suisse wealth arm reports EUR97bn net asset outflows in 2022,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Margaryta Kirakosian,"Wealth capabilities continue to be at the centre of growth plans for the group, which posted a EUR1.3bn pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter last year.","Credit Suisse's wealth management unit, which is at the centre of the bank's transformation plan, has posted EUR97bn net asset outflows for 2022.
The largest outflows fell on the fourth quarter at EUR93bn, out of which more than 60% were driven by deposit outflows.
Credit Suisse disclosed its wealth management numbers as part of its overall fourth quarter results, with the group as a whole reporting a EUR1.3bn pre-tax loss for the fourth quarter 2022. The bank's shares stood at $3.60 this morning, compared with $3.56 the previous day and a $3 low in December last year.
Assets under management for the wealth management division were down EUR204bn year on year, driven by net asset outflows, unfavourable market movements and reclassifications of EUR17.8bn related to the sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Wealth management revenues declined by 30% year-on-year, with the bank saying the performance in wealth management and Swiss banking was impacted by lower deposit levels and lower assets under management.
Credit Suisse said it continues to take proactive action to regain client inflows, but expects reduced net interest income and recurring commissions and fees, which will probably lead to a loss for wealth management in the first quarter of 2023.
One of the challenges the wealth division faces is retaining key relationship managers. During the year, a couple of teams have left - the latest departure being the LatAm desk trio who were based in Geneva.
Asset management in focus
The group's asset management division is a core growth focus alongside wealth management going forward.
The revenues of this arm were down 14% year on year, driven by lower performance transaction and placement revenues.
This was partly offset by higher investment and partnerships income, which was up 32%, mainly because of equity participation gains, including those from the disposal of the group's interest in Energy Infrastructure Partners.
The asset management arm had EUR22.8bn net outflows in 2022 across traditional investments and alternative investments and its overall asset base stood at EUR406bn at the end of the fourth quarter.
Half of those outflows (EUR11.8bn) came in the fourth quarter, which in the traditional investments segment were driven by multi-asset solutions, index solutions and fixed income and credit in alternative investments.
Update on supply-chain funds
The group has also made an update on the supply-chain funds liquidation proceedings.
For the Credit Suisse Nova (Lux) Supply Chain Finance Investment Grade fund, the final payment of $8.1m was made with a value date of 6 February 2023. This bought the total amount returned to investors to $285m, which represents more than 99% of the fund's net asset value at the time of its suspension.
For the Liechtenstein-domiciled Credit Suisse Supply Chain Finance Investment Grade fund, the final payment of liquidation proceeds of $31.3m was made with a value date of 11 November last year. This brought the total amount returned to investors to approximately $667m, amounting to more than 99% of the fund's net asset value at the time of suspension.
Credit Suisse introduced a fee waiver programme for clients impacted by the supply-chain fund issue, wherein certain commissions and fees arising from current and future business transactions may be reimbursed on a quarterly basis.
The group had negative revenues of EUR15m in the fourth quarter of 2022 relating to this fee waiver programme, mainly in wealth management.",https://citywireselector.com/news/credit-suisse-wealth-arm-reports-97bn-net-asset-outflows-in-2022/a2408888,0
2023-02-10,a2409026,"Buying Credit Suisse after the GFC was a mistake, says equity veteran",Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,John Coumarianos,"David Herro runs a streaky fund that has delivered big returns over the long haul. Coming off a rough recent run, he is off to a fast start in 2023.","Veteran US investor David Herro's team have owned Credit Suisse for nearly 20 years. They sold down the position during the Global Financial Crisis, but bought back in afterwards.
This was a mistake, he told Citywire in the USA, for reasons which are explained below.
Herro was discussing his Oakmark International
fund, which invests in non-US stocks, providing a foreigner's perspective on Europe's banking and automotive industries and his approach to emerging markets.
His Oakmark fund has a one-star Morningstar rating, leaving it firmly in the bottom quintile of the Foreign Large Value category for the five-year period. However, it's in the top quartile for 10 years and in the top percentile for the 15 years.
+ rated Herro, who was joined by Michael Manelli in 2016, completed his 30th year on the fund a few months ago. Over those three decades the fund surpassed the MSCI EAFE index by more than 2.5 percentage points on an annualized basis (7.63% compared to 4.92%).
In other words, for three decades, Herro turned an initial $100,000 (CHF 92,000) investment into nearly $908,000, compared to a little more than $422,000 for the index.
So far in 2022, some of the calls that hurt Herro over the past few years are coming good and it looks like he's back in the driver's seat, with a 13.8% return, landing it in the top 3% of its peer group.
Citywire: You mentioned in a recent investor letter that your portfolio trades at a little more than 50% of your fair value estimate. Is that an all-time low, or close to one?
David Herro: Typically, we've seen it range from high 40s to the high 70s. There have been three outliers to the downside where it was high 30s or low 40s. Outlier one was in March 2009. Outlier two was the pandemic bottom. And oddly enough the third time it was that low was August-September of last year. The other two were huge macro shocks. This one involved us being overweight in Europe because of valuation, and also the decline of European currencies and then the invasion.
Now we're just near a typical bottom. A typical top would be somewhere between 70% and 80%.
This kind of entry point in the past has led to outperformance over the next few years. Extremes are the best, but people are scared to invest in them.
CW: US investors in foreign stocks struggled last year with the rising dollar. How do you deal with currency in the fund?
DH: We employ currency hedging when the dollar is weak and the currencies that we own [are strong]. If that currency is more than 20% overvalued as measured by purchasing power parity we will hedge some of that currency back to US dollar.
For example, the euro hit a high of almost 160 in March 2008, and at that time we would have been 50-60% hedged. But then it began to weaken, [hitting] a 20-year low in September [2022], where it traded just below par.
It's come up since then, but we still have the euro significantly undervalued by purchasing power parity, and it becomes stimulative by increasing exports. My argument towards the end of the summer was not only are the stocks cheap, but you can buy them in weak currencies, so you have a kind of double discount.
CW: Three banks - Intesa Sanpaolo, BNP Paribas, and Lloyds - are at the top of your portfolio. Also Credit Suisse is your 11th-largest holding, having been higher before. What's attractive about these banks right now?
There have been other kinds of macro disturbances after the global financial crisis. We had the Greek crisis, etc... Then came lower [rates] for longer and slower growth. But we thought that couldn't last forever. Banks were building capital.
We thought this would be temporary, and now we're finally starting to see the capital build is over. Lending is going up, interest rate spreads are going up, and now the thesis is playing out.
Credit Suisse aside, some of the highest-quality banks - Intesa, Lloyds, BNP - are trading at ridiculously [low] price-to-book, low price-to-earnings ratios, and high dividend yields. Every one of those companies has excess capital so that they are increasing dividends and buying back stock. And buying back stock at 60% to 70% of book value is extremely value accretive.
Regarding Credit Suisse - we've owned it for almost two decades, buying back in after the GFC after selling down our position successfully. This was a mistake looking in the rear-view mirror.
We thought they were going to concentrate on the three main businesses - private banking, asset management, and The Swiss Universal Bank. The fourth business - investment banking - unfortunately robbed the other three of earnings. Various chairmen said they were going to come in and derisk the investment bank and focus on the other three areas. We were in agreement with that, but they didn't execute that plan.
So, finally, they sold parts of it. However, the cost of doing this was high. When they sold the securitized products division, with it went deferred tax assets that counted as capital. So they had to raise capital. And we don't know what they got for securitized products, and so our view has changed on Credit Suisse, and that's why you see a much lower position size.
We're hopeful there's value, but they have to turn it around. In the meantime, these other European financials have 10%+ free cash flow yields.
(According to Morningstar data, Herro increased the Credit Suisse position in Oakmark International from nearly 90 million shares at the beginning of 2022 to 94 million shares at the end of September of 2022, but then sold roughly one-third this position, reducing it to 66 million shares by the end of the year.)
CW: You hold both Mercedes Benz and BMW. Despite the luxury cachet of the two automakers, some might say these are capital-intensive businesses in an industry with tough competition. What's your reply?
On Mercedes Benz - it was part of Daimler and a turnaround story - we were about to sell out of the name four years ago. We were disappointed [because] the company was run like a bureaucracy more than a profit-maximizing business.
We thought the new management team was capable and committed (you need both) and they've turned things around.
Premium automakers earn higher margins than the mass producers. Typically, you'll see margins of 10%. Porsche's are in the high teens, and Ferrari's are low 20s. These makers have learned through the pandemic to focus on profitability more than volume. You can have double-digit margins, and that gives you really good returns on capital.
BMW never had problems with return on capital. Now you see it with double-digit margins; same with Mercedes. They're trading at probably 3x EV/Ebit or cash flow. And this is a sector you want to be in because there's structural growth with the premium producers in emerging markets as people go from lower to middle to upper middle [class].
CW: Quantitative value investors view emerging markets as cheap. Is your stock-by-stock approach uncovering opportunities in EM?
DH: Some of the [EM] index looks undervalued. But you can't [approach] it that way. Take Chinese banks. Bank of China trades at 3.5x earnings; it looks really cheap. [It has the] same yield as European banks. [But] who knows the value of its assets? Also, the corporate governance stinks. So to us these prices are meaningless.
Even take Petrobras, [which] looks cheap on paper. But the government controls the price of gas at the pump, so it's sold at a loss. Especially in EM, it's important to be a bottom-up stock picker. There are landmines out there. You have to go below headline valuation.",https://citywireselector.com/news/buying-credit-suisse-after-the-gfc-was-a-mistake-says-equity-veteran/a2409026,3
2023-02-10,a2409014,Stagflation fears knock UK market off its perch,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Gavin Lumsden,The UK economy may have technically avoided a recession but the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 retreat as consumer spending falls and China reports weak global demand.,"The FTSE 100 slipped from yesterday's peak as even a spike in oil majors BP and Shell in response to Russia's plans to cut oil production next month was not enough to offset concerns about the UK economy and rising interest rates.
The UK's blue-chip index retreated 0.3%, or 24 points, to 7,887, weighed down by financials, real estate and healthcare stocks.
This followed an overnight fall on Wall Street, where investors assessed the smaller-than-expected decline in companies' earnings in the reporting season so far.
Asian markets were also subdued after the price of goods leaving factory gates in China fell more than expected. Richard Hunter of Interactive Investor said this suggested the expected strength of the global economic rebound had yet to take hold.
'The more recent caution has done little to hamper what has otherwise been a strong start to the year,' Hunter said, pointing to the 5.7% rally in the FTSE 100 and the 7.1% recovery in the more domestic-facing FTSE 250, adding that the 'feeling of some release from tightening monetary shackles' was boosting 'riskier asset classes' such as stocks.
'In the year to date, the most notable recovery index in the US has been the Nasdaq, which has added 12.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 is ahead by 6.3% and the Dow Jones by 1.7%,' he said.
Standard Chartered (STAN), the Asia-focused bank, fell 4.8% to 731p after First Abu Dhabi Bank denied a Bloomberg report yesterday that it was considering a bid, sending its shares 11% higher on Thursday.
BP (BP) and Shell (SHEL) provided some upward momentum, rising 2.8% and 1.4% respectively after oil prices jumped more than 2%, with Brent crude futures at $86.67 (PS71.57) a barrel in response to Russia's announcement that it would reduce its production by 500,000 barrels a day, or 5% of output.
Consumer stocks were weak after Germany's Adidas warned of a high single-digit decline in sales this year, helping to depress the EuroStoxx 50, down 0.6% at 4,226, after hitting a one-year high yesterday.
Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the UK narrowly avoided a recession in the last quarter of 2022, with zero growth over the three months, but the economy shrank 0.5% in December. This fits with the Bank of England's forecast last week that the UK would suffer a long but shallow recession.
'An absence of a contraction over the fourth quarter means the economy avoided a technical recession over the second half of the year (GDP in the third quarter was revised up a shade to show a decline of 0.2% on the quarter),' said Investec economist Philip Shaw.
'However, we remain of the view that downward pressure on household income will result in a shallow recession over most or all of 2023, especially as consumers react to a higher Bank rate and as over 1.5 million mortgagers face steep increases in their mortgage payments as their rates are reset. Our GDP forecast for 2023 is -1.0%,' Shaw said.
'News that the UK has managed to avoid being in a technical recession gave a small lift to the pound, putting it briefly at $1.2130, but still some way off the $1.2434 level seen in January,' said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 'Zero GDP growth is hardly a reason to celebrate, and markets are certainly not jumping for joy.'
The brief strength in the pound added to the pressure on the large number of dollar earners in the FTSE 100.

2023-02-10,a2408924,Why this HY bond boss is 'sanguine' about defaults rising,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ian Heath,Mike Scott believes the economy isn't through the worst of it but there are clear ways to navigate near-term headwinds.,"As the debate rages on about whether there will be a soft or hard landing, or even no recession at all this year, Man GLG's Mike Scott does not have high hopes for the economy.
The head of global high-yield and credit opportunities said interest rate hikes still had some way to go, and that the same goes for their impact on the economy.
'We don't think that central banks are done yet, no matter what the market is pricing. Central banks certainly continue to bring up short-end industry interest rates, and I think Europe is behind the US with that respect,' he told Citywire Selector.
'As we go through this year, the interest rate rises and the impact on the real economy are yet to be fully felt. My view is that we've probably seen a third of the impact being felt.'
Scott said more bond defaults were inevitable but was adamant that his five-strong analysis-focused team could navigate the pitfalls.
'Defaults are part of the asset class. It's always about relative value in everything we do and whether we're being paid for the risks. Defaults will pick up. A recessionary backdrop in developed markets will be a feature of this year, notwithstanding some of the more positive data we've had recently, with some disinflationary pressures.
'There could be kind of twists and turns to that, but broadly speaking, fundamental pressures will be greater than they were last year. But there's a distinction within the credit market as to where they will be particularly more prone to being exposed to defaults.'
He highlighted European high-yield bonds as an area with particularly strong credit quality.
'A lot of businesses there have been able to push out their maturities, so their maturity walls don't come into play until 2025 to 2026. I think only 9% or so of nominal outstanding comes in the next two years. It's quite a low number. Coupled with that is lower leverage coming into this.
'We do consider this a late-cycle environment and, typically, that would be characterised by high leverage. But given the strength of the Covid rebound, a lot of businesses have been deleveraging in the higher yield market.
'From a fundamental perspective, we're much more sanguine about default rates that you would typically see in a weak growth backdrop. We think Europe will be mostly mid-single digit defaults and potentially the US could be mid to high single-digit. These are in our worst-case outcomes.'
He believes financial institutions could fare well, buoyed by the higher-interest-rate environment. 'We see higher interest rates feeding through into the earnings power of different financial institutions, particularly those that have relatively high exposure to floating-rate mortgages.
'Areas of the Iberian banking sector we think are attractive because they're seeing almost immediate follow-through leverage to the rising interest rates. We particularly like retail banks with relatively low-risk lending.'
Scott's team has both a top-down macro and bottom-up analysis approach, which he said was essential in the high-yield space.
'You should think of us as a fundamental credit team. We approach everything from an analytical and bottom-up perspective. That is the primary driver of our time and returns. That said, we also combine that with top-down thematic work as well.
'The reason we believe that this is the right approach is that often high-yield companies are quite small. Typically, they can be quite affected by changes in the prevailing landscape and risks, regardless of how good that individual company is.
'Having a keen focus on both bottom-up and top-down, and integrating that into our process, is fairly different from elsewhere.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/why-this-hy-bond-boss-is-sanguine-about-defaults-rising/a2408924,1
2023-02-10,a2408836,Morningstar global CIO: Beware of 'narratives' in an uncertain climate,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ian Heath,Asset allocator Dan Kemp says taking too certain a view of the future is 'dangerous' and macro trends will no longer drive markets.,"Deeper analysis of companies and avoidance of narratives is key for investors, as macro trends will have less influence on uncertain markets in the future.
That's according to Dan Kemp, global CIO at ratings and research giant Morningstar.
Speaking to Citywire Selector, Kemp said 2022's market corrections had created a more level playing field across sectors and regions, meaning investors need to take a closer look at what they're buying.
'We have a situation where overall the asset class universe for investors looks more attractively valued than it did at the start of 2022. But there's much less differentiation between countries, sectors and industries.
'It's really important, as we look forward, to dig a little bit more deeply and get beyond this idea that everything's driven by macro, which was really embedded into us during the Covid period.
'We need to start looking at individual companies, industries and parts of industries that have got swept along in the broader narratives of the market.
'Rather than thinking macro is going to drive the market, we need to understand that where macro has driven us to is a place where there is less differentiation in the big chunks of the market.'
Kemp acknowledged that investors are uneasy with the uncertain environment but the 'most dangerous thing' they could do is be pulled in by a glib narrative.
'Once you've convinced yourself of a narrative, you're more likely to be surprised. A narrative could be inflation is transitory, inflation is going to be higher for longer, large US tech stocks are too large to continue to grow.
'Another would be when you're buying Tesla, it's a one-decision stock. You just buy it and it doesn't matter what the valuation is. You need to be aware of people that have a very compelling view of what the future will hold because, in reality, the future is genuinely uncertain.'
Kemp said investors are more likely to be seduced by narratives in uncertain environments. 'The definition of uncertainty is a situation where not only do you not know what the outcome is going to be, but you don't know the range of possible outcomes either.
'Risk is a situation where you don't have the outcome, but you know the range of outcomes. As an investor, it's very tempting to try to limit uncertainty by converting it into risk. Then because we're still typically uncomfortable with risk, we convert risk into narratives, which gives us certainty.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/morningstar-global-cio-beware-of-narratives-in-an-uncertain-climate/a2408836,0

2023-02-10,a2408754,A bloody tale about the lost art of face-to-face meetings,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,"OPINION: Fund selectors often talk about the need for physical interaction but this imperative runs across the entire industry, as one of my more colourful interviews illustrated.","When I was a young reporter, I landed an interview with a big fund manager at quite short notice. The manager - who will remain anonymous for reasons that will become clear - was known to be a relatively intense individual, so I prepared myself as well as I could.
The meeting was scheduled for 5pm but as I sat in the lobby of his offices, I was informed it would actually be pushed back to 5.30pm Then 5.45pm. Then 6pm. At that point I was told the manager now only had 15 minutes available - down from the previously agreed hour.
Fine, I thought. It would be a whistlestop tour of key ideas but better than going home empty-handed. I would have to maximise the time, the person organising the meeting stressed, as I was led upstairs.
Oh, they quickly added, the fund manager had sliced the very end of his finger off while making a quick salad. But I wasn't to mention that or draw attention to it.
Armed with this alarming additional information, I was greeted by a slightly distracted manager who had poured a viscous pink liquid plaster agent into a cut on his fingertip, which merged with the blood stains on his hand.
Keep calm and carry on
As agreed, I didn't acknowledge what looked like a medical emergency as we discussed markets, his outlook and current allocation ideas. The conversation continued, even when he inadvertently smeared his bloody finger on his pristine white shirt while making an enthusiastic point.
If you have gleaned enough from this jigsaw of information to work out who I interviewed (and when), you will notice the copy is shorn of this additional colour - no pun intended. However, I never looked at the portfolio manager in quite the same way ever again and all future interactions were filtered through a finger-chopping prism which flashed back into my head after watching the Banshees of Inishiren.
Why am I telling you this? With apologies to the squeamish or those tucking into their lunch, but this has become a go-to story for me when instructing new journalists about the importance of meeting someone face to face, as phone calls, emailed responses or video calls can hide all manner of interesting details.
Not every fund manager interview will end with bloodshed but the experience taught me a lot about the single-mindedness of the manager in question. Much can be gained from going directly to the source and seeing how they operate.
What you might have missed
Syz Group founder Eric Syz once told me, during a meeting over breakfast no less, that he had been inclined to work with a US investment house after many fruitful calls with the manager.
However, upon visiting the potential investee on their home turf, he realised that the fund manager had cornered off one-third of their entire floor space for his own private office, leaving the wider team to squish together in the remaining space. An element of extreme self-involvement that would have been lost without venturing out to meet him in person.
Of course, the world of video conferencing has made things easier and reduced the hours lost travelling between conferences and catch-ups, but as the world returns to something resembling normality, the benefits of these face-to-face interactions are set to be revived as well.
Therefore, I have pledged to do more. A small number of people will be aghast to hear this, as I've declined a lot of invites, but the ability to talk openly and in person is as crucial to the journalistic side of finance as it is to the client/provider side. And, as long as nobody loses a finger, I am sure we will all get along just fine.",https://citywireselector.com/news/a-bloody-tale-about-the-lost-art-of-face-to-face-meetings/a2408754,1

2023-02-10,a2408956,Investors urge European banks to end oil and gas financing,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,"Investors representing $1.5tn in AUM are asking banks, including BNP Paribas, to stop financing new oil and gas fields by the end of 2023, following successful engagement with HSBC.","Candriam, Nest and 28 other investors with more than $1.5tn in assets under management are calling for Europe's five largest banks to stop providing direct finance to new oil and gas fields by the end of this year.
Barclays, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale and Deutsche Bank have provided a combined $188bn toward oil and gas expanders between 2016 and 2021, according to ShareAction.
In a letter coordinated by ShareAction, the investors said that financing new oil and gas fields is holding back the renewable energy transition in Europe and risks jeopardising the global path to net-zero emissions.
The investors highlighted that the International Energy Agency (IEA)warned last year that there was no room for new oil and gas fields beyond 2021 if the world is to have a 50% chance of reaching net zero by 2050, and that the five banks' financing decisions could influence this outcome.
'Far from locking in long-term dependence on insecure, unpredictable, volatile and environmentally damaging fossil energy, Russia's actions are a salient reminder of the need to accelerate away from fossil to renewable. [New oil and gas] projects would make the transition harder to achieve by locking in high-carbon infrastructure and leading to even more risk of stranded assets. In turn creating additional financial, environmental and reputational risk for banks and their investors,' the letter stated.
The letter comes as HSBC, the largest financier of top oil and gas expanders, announced in December that it will cease such lending and capital markets financing activities. The banks targeted by investors were the largest European financiers of oil and gas expanders after HSBC during 2016-2021, according to ShareAction.
Sophie Deleuze, lead ESG analyst, stewardship at Candriam, said HSBC's decision to stop financing new oil and gas fields was a 'direct result of strong, collaborative engagement from investors' that reaffirmed the investor group's ambition to make this the new minimum standard.
Anders Schelde, CIO of AkademikerPension, said that the banking sector's continued financing of oil and gas projects is 'unacceptable in 2023'.
'We're running out of time to avert the worst consequences of climate disaster, and the banking sector is still struggling to implement the bare minimum. Stopping direct financing of new oil and gas fields in breach of IEA recommendations is an absolute minimum to expect from banks that proclaim to have a green profile,' said Schelde.
Jeanne Martin, head of the banking programme at ShareAction, said the investor-backed letters 'should be a wakeup call to banks that have made net-zero commitments'.
'First, they must stop directly financing new oil and gas fields. Second, banks must urgently turn their attention to the companies that are enabling new oil and gas fields to be discovered and developed. As the letters point out, direct financing is only the tip of the iceberg. Investors are putting these banks on notice that they will face ever-increasing pressure if they don't act soon to reverse their financing of new oil and gas,' said Martin.

2023-02-10,a2409005,GAM backer cuts exposure for third time in quick succession,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,John Schaffer,German investor Jorg Bantleon has further reduced his stake after holding more than 10% in October.,"Jorg Bantleon has further reduced his stake in GAM below the 3% threshold, which comes one month after the German investor fell below the 5% range for holdings in the Swiss asset manager.
GAM made the announcement via a SIX Exchange filing on 9 February.
Back in October last year Bantleon held 11.3% of the asset manager's shares but he cut this to 4.24% in January.
The Munich-based group had built up exposure after GAM appointed Peter Sanderson as chief executive officer in summer 2019. It had held around 5% of the business prior to Sanderson being handed the top job.
Earlier this week, Citywire Selector reported that New York-based Global Emerging Markets (GEM) had increased its stake in GAM from 3.13% to 5% via its Luxembourg-domiciled GEM Global Yield fund.
Bantleon has now slipped off the list of those with significant exposure - meaning above 3%. Silchester International Investors remains the largest external investor, with a 15% exposure.
GAM last last month announced projected losses of $336m and said it would delay the publication of its 2022 results.
Results for the period will now come out two months later than planned, as the firm said it needed more time to work on an ongoing strategic review of its business direction.

The latter was her top-performing fund. Over the three years to December 2022 gained 21.4%, versus the Global Growth sector average of 5.7%.
Fairbanks told Citywire Selector she had 'no concrete plans yet', but was 'exploring a few interesting opportunities'.
Stepping in to fill Fairbanks's role is Soliane Varlet, Mirova's head of European equities and diversity thematics.
She will run the fund alongside the existing managers Hua Cheng and Jens Peers.
Varlet has 17 years of portfolio management experience and has been with Mirova since 2008. She will continue to be based in Paris, France.
A Mirova spokesperson said the global sustainable equity team will be reinforced in the coming months by a senior portfolio manager, following Fairbanks's departure.",https://citywireselector.com/news/outperforming-sustainable-equities-pm-exits-mirova/a2408929,7

The multi-billion coalition will see Pensioenfonds PGB work closely with Osmosis to reduce environmental impact across developed market equity portfolios.
Osmosis was selected to construct the bespoke portfolio based on its equity strategies' strong environmental and financial track record.
The PGB allocation will be used to create a segregated, customised strategy based on Osmosis's flagship EUR683m Resource Efficient Core Equity fund.
An Osmosis spokesperson said: 'The portfolio targets a better risk-adjusted return through its overweight exposures to resource-efficient companies and underweight exposures to inefficient companies, and delivers an immediate reduction in carbon, water and waste ownership in excess of 50% relative to the current portfolio.'
Osmosis's model of resource efficiency is the product of 13 years' in-house quantitative and proprietary environmental data research that involves collecting, cleaning and standardising the carbon emissions, water consumption and waste generation of more than 850 companies worldwide, an Osmosis spokesperson said.
On a sector-relative basis, the strategy overweights companies identified by the Osmosis research programme as resource efficient while underweighting those companies identified as resource inefficient.
Ben Dear, CEO and founding partner of Osmosis, said: 'Delivering immediate and significant environmental reductions while targeting better risk-adjusted returns, our core strategies enable our clients to meet the long-term funding requirements of their customers through a highly diversified, cost-efficient, and liquid portfolio that encourages mainstream adoption of sustainable investing.
'It is important that the asset management industry continue building innovative solutions to help investors transition their capital. Only through partnerships with forward-thinking investors like PGB will we stand a chance of reaching any of the goals set at Paris, Glasgow, or Sharm El Sheikh.'

2023-02-13,a2409200,Morningstar fund downgrade baffles Matthews Asia CIO,Morningstar downgrade,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Caroline Hug,"Robert Horrocks queried Morningstar's downgrade of the Matthews Asia Dividend fund last year, but says it has been renamed to avoid confusion about the investment approach.","Matthews Asia chief investment officer Robert Horrocks has questioned Morningstar's decision to downgrade its Asia Dividend fund, with the move prompting the firm to rename the strategy to give investors great clarity.
Morningstar downgraded the Matthews Asia Dividend fund
to 'bronze' in September of last year. Analysts explained it was demoted for veering from its previous strategy of buying dividend-paying stocks to having more of a dividend growth strategy.
'The portfolio has always talked about dividend payers and dividend growers through a blended 60/40 approach,' Horrocks said. 'We look for where to get the best value in the market.
'Over the past seven-to-eight years, the market has focused on the growers rather than the payers. By a process of the outperformance of our holdings in the portfolio with subsequent better returns, our portfolio moved towards 60% growers/40% payers.'
Horrocks believes the name of the Asia Dividend portfolio may have led others to confuse the strategy with an income or high-yield portfolio.
'It's never been that,' he said. 'We use that dividend component as a return of income over time.'
Fund name change
The downgrade prompted the firm to change the name of the fund to provide investors with better clarity.
From now on it will be known as the Asia ex-Japan Total Return Equity Strategy.
A Matthews Asia spokesperson said that the name change 'will enhance investors' understanding of the core investment objective of the sub-fund'.
This would tweak the language of the fund's approach from an emphasis on 'providing current income' to 'capital appreciation and current income'.
The changes in the fund's name will be reflected on 17 February.
It was announced the Matthews Asia Dividend fund will also have its investment language tweaked.
Funds underperformance explained
Both the Asia Dividend and the Asia ex Japan Dividend
strategies have underperformed over the past year.
While the Asia Dividend fund lost 30% against an MSCI Asia Pacific benchmark loss of 16.9%, the Matthews Asia ex Japan Dividend fund lost 26% against an MSCI Asia ex Japan benchmark loss of 19.4%.
'It's mainly been down to the geographic exposure of our funds,' explained Horrocks. 'We have a high weighting to China, which we're happy to maintain.'
Both funds also held an overweight position in Vietnam, with an 11% allocation to the region. Horrocks believed the country's economic stability was reasonable, yet the market underestimated this, bringing prices down.
According to Horrocks, the areas that did well in the index last year were low-quality North Asian banks. As the funds did not own these banks, their performance suffered.
'As we look forward, the geographic risks of the portfolio will diminish,' said Horrocks. 'In terms of now owning horrible banks, we will continue to not own horrible banks.'
Both funds also have significant exposure to Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba, as well as a hefty allocation to TSMC.
Horrocks is not worried about the geopolitical threat around Taiwan, due to what he sees as the improbable likelihood of China taking Taiwan by force.
'There's no logical sequence of steps whereby China would invade,' he said. 'If they did, they would reunify the land, which would minimise damage - but the likelihood of this happening is very low.'
Additionally, the value of the Taiwanese semiconductor business has been underlined by its government, and therefore the stock stands at a reasonable price, says Horrocks.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/morningstar-fund-downgrade-baffles-matthews-asia-cio/a2409200,4

Housebuilders fall on downgrades by Deutsche Bank.","The FTSE 100 shuffled higher as markets braced for a flurry of economic data, with all eyes on tomorrow's US inflation numbers.
The UK blue-chip index gained 0.25%, or 19 points, to 7,902, after its retreat on Friday with US inflation once again the main macroeconomic issue after revised data showed the country's consumer prices rose in December instead of falling as previously thought.
The consumer price index (CPI) edged up 0.1% in December rather than dipping by that amount, which Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said was 'all to do with recalculating seasonal adjustment factors, which is used to strip out seasonal fluctuations'.
'If the market thinks inflation is coming down, then any print that points in the opposite direction will have a very severe disruptive effect on equity prices, as well as bonds,' Wilson said.
'This all makes tomorrow's CPI print [for January] all the more important for the market... Remember, the US Federal Reserve has ditched full gremlin mode and is now data dependent,' he added.
Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: 'The consensus is for the rate to have risen by 0.4% for the month, although ahead of the release, upward revisions to the November and December figures unsettled investors who were assuming that the battle with inflation was all but over.
'However, the recent blowout non-farm payrolls number and stubborn inflation within the services sector are reintroducing question marks over the extent of the progress made so far.'
Matthew Weller of City Index said if tomorrow's CPI also suggests US inflation is more entrenched with a headline reading above 6.5%, or a 'core' figure over 5.5%, it would hit risk assets and the Australian dollar as traders start to price in a 50 basis points interest rate rise from the Federal Reserve next month.
'Regardless of how this month's CPI report prints, it's clear that we're in a new regime where inflation data trumps all other releases, and traders who ignore this shift do so at their own peril,' he said.
Weir (WEIR) was the biggest riser, adding 2.2%, or 41p, to PS18.41 after Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on the engineering company with a 'buy' recommendation and a target price of PS22.20.
BA-owner International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) followed with a 1.6%, or 2p, gain to 163p, while National Grid (NG) strengthened 1.6%, or 16p, to PS10.51 ahead of results from Centrica (CNA) later this week, with the British Gas owner up 1.2% at 99p.
Housebuilders weighed on the index after Deutsche Bank issued a raft of downgrades in the sector. Persimmon (PSN) led the fallers, down 2.4%, or 37p, at PS14.54, as the bank's analysts cut their rating to 'sell' from 'hold'; Taylor Wimpey (TW) off 1.8%, or 2p, at 119p, cut from 'buy' to 'hold'; and Barratt Developments (BDEV) was also moved from 'buy' to 'hold', leaving it 1.2%, or 5p, lower at 466p.
The more domestic FTSE 250 struggled for direction too, edging up 17 points to 20,046. Mid-cap housebuilders also retreated following the Deutsche note with Crest Nicholson (CRST) sliding 3.3% to 239p and Redrow (RDW) falling 2.1% to 519p.
WAG Payment Solutions (WPS) pushed 3.7%, or 3p, higher to 82p, after the European trucking payment processor reported revenues rose 24% to EUR134m in its full-year results.
Professional services firm JTC (JTC) was up 2.3% or 17p, at 745p after HSBC analysts raised their target price from 960p to 965p, while cybersecurity firm Darktrace (DARK) added 2.5% to 245p.
In investment trust news, shares in Abrdn Smaller Companies Income (ASCI ) soared 14% to 280p after the PS68m portfolio said it was looking to merge with another investment trust following a tough 2022 which saw it become too small and illiquid to be viable.

2023-02-13,a2408780,Frontier equities expert reveals how he outperformed in 2022,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Krystle Higgins,"Ali Hussain shares his views on why sustainable investing in the Nordics is not always the shrewdest call, and how he finds hidden frontier market leaders.","Ali Hussain, head of research at Frontier Investment Management Partners believes a sustainability bias gave his firm's strategies the edge last year, in what was a severely challenging time for equity markets.
In addition, he said his team's ability to find undiscovered market leaders lifted them above the average losses across the asset class.
The FIM EM Frontier fund, managed by Hedi Ben Mlouka and Sandeep Srinivas, delivered a gross return of -11.3% versus -18.2% for the MSCI FEM index in 2022, according to an end-of-year report authored by Hussian.
Another way to measure impact
Assessing the specific impact a company will have rather than simply looking at broad ESG themes is key, said Hussain.
To do this, Hussain and his team employ a method they call CAT (congruence, additionality, and transition) which allows them to find lesser-known firms which deliver a measurable impact.
Congruence means gauging what percentage of revenues are likely to be impactful, and then subtracting the negatives from that. So, a company producing vegetarian food could be making a positive impact, for example, but its plastic packaging might score negatively.
Additionality, meanwhile, requires questioning what this firm contributes to a particular issue and whether that is unique. For example, it is undoubtedly impactful to build a school, but if there are 20 schools in the area already, then what are you adding to the region?
Lastly, transition looks at a firm's future plans for reducing power and water consumption, among other green metrics.
Growth, and digitisation
One example of distinguishing between actual impact versus a structural theme, is the frontier market healthcare sector, said Hussain.
'Hospital beds per 1,000 people in our markets is usually less than one, whereas the OECD average is 4.7. So if you add the population multiplier, meaning we're home to almost 4 billion people, there needs to be double the amount of beds to deal with that. I think the growth trajectory is there and that is where the difference comes in from an impact perspective.'
Renewables are key to frontier market impact investment, because of these economies' growing populations and need for digitisation. This is why Hussain believes investors should not discount the region over developed markets which face issues such as ageing populations.
'If you invest in renewables in the Nordics, for example. How much growth will you really get? Because they are already at around 70% renewables, whereas in our case that number is no more than 10%.
'So, with the fastest growing population in the world behind you, your electricity needs are growing. Developed market demographics are aging, so the population growth is not there. When it comes to clean, sustainable housing, infrastructure, health and education - these are all things which have long growth drivers in frontier markets.'
2023 fund launch
Speaking from his Dubai office, Hussain said the firm is preparing to launch a new emerging market impact-focused fund within the next six months, which will complement two distinct existing strategies.
One of these is focused exclusively on the Middle East and North Africa as well as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. Meanwhile, the other broader emerging frontier strategy concentrates on the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, as well Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of central Eastern Europe.
'The purpose of this is to keep a sort of distinction on what's happening in large emerging markets, which we believe are highly correlated to developed markets,' Hussain said.",https://citywireselector.com/news/frontier-equities-expert-reveals-how-he-outperformed-in-2022/a2408780,2

Gylfe was most recently part of Handelsbanken Fonder's multi-manager solutions team and was responsible for the firm's multi-asset funds. He will move into a similar role at SEB Investment Management's multi-management team.
Staffan Fredholm, head of fixed income at SEB Investment Management, told Citywire Selector the appointment does not replace any departing team member and that Gylfe's hire is a strengthening, senior presence in the team.

Bestinvest's latest Spot the Dog report shows that assets in products that have underperformed their benchmark for three years in a row - and have underperformed for the last three years as a whole - rose to PS19.1bn at the end of December from PS10.7bn at the end of June.
Over the same period, the number of funds in the doghouse rose from 31 to 44, or 34%, with Schroders once again responsible for the most mandates on the list.
UK All Companies and Equity Income strategies accounted for 60% of assets in dog funds this time, despite the FTSE 100 rising nearly 1% last year as the MSCI World index fell more than 7%.
Assets in underperforming funds rose from PS5.5bn to PS8.4bn for the UK All Companies sector and from PS2.1bn to PS3.1bn for the UK Equity income sector.
Bestinvest attributed the increase to the sectors' exposure to smaller and medium-sized stocks, with MSCI's UK Small Cap benchmark underperforming the MSCI UK Large Cap index by more than 20% in 2022.
Among the UK equity strategies hit by lack of exposure to blue chips were Unicorn's Outstanding British Companies , UK Income
and UK Ethical Income funds.
Columbia Threadneedle's UK Equity Opportunities , Select UK
Equity
and UK Extended Alpha
funds joined the pack for similar reasons, as did the Ninety One UK Special Situations
fund.
Several repeat UK equity underperformers also featured, with multiple long-term stragglers run by Schroders causing the asset manager to account for just over a third of the total amount in dog funds, at PS7.2bn.
Schroders' UK Multi-Cap Income
fund featured in the list, alongside the Scottish Widows UK Growth
and UK Equity Income
funds.
Other dog funds included Halifax's Special Situations , UK Growth
and UK Equity Income
funds, also run by Schroders.
'While it's been a choppier period for markets, investors can legitimately ask why the funds show no signs of turning around,' said Bestinvest.
The UK asset manager with the second-highest sum of assets in repeated poor performers was Invesco, with PS3bn held by its Responsible Japanese Equity Value Discovery
and UK Equity High Income funds.
The latter was formerly run by Mark Barnett, with new managers Ciaran Mallon and James Goldstone failing to turn around the fund since taking it on two-and-a-half years ago.
Coming third was St James's Place, with persistent underperformance in the firm's PS2.2bn International Equity fund pushing it into the list.
'While the group has recently switched the sub-advised manager on the International Equity fund, it is not yet clear that it has borne fruit,' said Bestinvest.
The strategy's entry into the list, alongside the PS1.7bn HL Multi-Manager Special Situations
trust, meant the volume of underperforming assets in the Global sector more than quadrupled from PS873m to PS4.5bn.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/dog-fund-assets-soar-to-19bn-as-uk-stock-pickers-lag-ftse/a2409188,21

2023-02-13,a2409058,EMD chief on what the earthquake in Turkey means for the asset class,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Krystle Higgins,GMO's Tina Vandersteel discusses how she is navigating her position in Turkey following the devastating earthquake.,"When the news broke on 6 February that a massive earthquake had hit Turkey and Syria, a catastrophe which has now claimed more than 20,000 lives, Tina Vandersteel did two things.
First, check with a Turkish member of her team whether his family was safe, before then sitting down at her computer to see how the markets had reacted.
'Thankfully his family were alright, as they lived in a different region of Turkey,' said Vandersteel, who is and head of emerging market country debt at GMO.
Vandersteel has experienced many upheavals within the developing world during her career and her professional response is to try and find a positive default convex position - one where she can generate alpha if a default occurs.
'My job is to think about getting alpha and positive returns, and how I can set up positive default convex positions. That is what gets me out of bed in the morning,' she said.
Vandersteel oversees a range of funds, including the EUR2bn GMO Emerging Country Debt
fund, which the US investment house launched as a Ucits-compliant version
in 2019. Mexico, Turkey, Oman and the Dominican Republic currently represent the largest country exposures in this fund.
Looking at Turkey's wider economic picture, Vandersteel said the country is well-priced and at a low risk of defaulting. Despite strong credit scores and low debt, the country's debt trades wider than the underlying fundamentals would suggest.
Vandersteel said one unpredictable element is President Erdogan, and this could become more of an issue with elections on the horizon in May. Vandersteel believes she could collect an 'unpredictability premium' if she stays overweight Turkey.
Judging how long they can afford to stay overweight while hedging for some catastrophic event, is key, however.
Not all defaults are equal
One example of this strategy in action is how Vandersteel positioned the fund in the lead-up to Ghana defaulting in 2022. 'We were pretty overweight in Ghana if they paid, but very underweight, if they defaulted.
'They ended up limping into default at the end of the year. So that was a positive alpha event for us which for some people is counter-intuitive because they would say: ""Well wait, you were overweight?"".
'To which I would point out that, yes, I was overweight if they paid but underweight if they did not. Which is something that you can set up in the bond market that you can't set up in an equity market. This is why I prefer the bond market.'
Turkey's case is not quite as simple, said Vandersteel, as Ghana's debt levels were much more challenged. Turkey, on the other hand, would have to had undergone some sizeable economic missteps to reach the same level.
'We think he [Erdogan] would need to screw up and lose the faith of domestic depositors. If you look at the local market in Turkey, real interest rates are crazy negative and people don't want to hold the Turkish lira.
'So, they sell their lira for dollars, while holding them in the Turkish banking system. So long as they don't convert those dollars to foreign banks, like Argentina does for example, then there's no capital flight. Which means they can limp along and possibly get through the election.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/emd-chief-on-what-the-earthquake-in-turkey-means-for-the-asset-class/a2409058,3
2023-02-13,a2409054,Careers: Top tips for job applicants and those hiring them,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Rafat Ali,Here is a great checklist from a seasoned media CEO.,"I have conducted hundreds of job interviews while building two media companies over the past two decades. And over the years I have written down some very basic tips for standing out as a potential employee of a company like Skift (or any company, really).
These tips are even more relevant in the post-pandemic world, where a lot of interviews happen online. Skift came out of the pandemic as a totally remote business, but that may be the exception rather than the rule in asset management.
So here is the advice I would give to job applicants. And for prospective employers, it's a great checklist to see if the person on the other side of the table or screen might be the right choice for you:
Always write a cover letter and send it through the regular channels, but also directly to the hiring manager if you can figure out who that is. For key roles, even share it with the top executives. VERY IMPORTANT: do not make the letter all about you. Focus on why you would like to work for the company and why you are a good fit. Do not be overeager or overeffusive.
Always, always, always follow up with anyone and everyone you meet during the interview process. Even better? Send a handwritten letter, if you can feasibly ask for the hiring manager's address in this remote, working-from-home world. In the advanced stages of the interview process, this will have a big impact.
This is a hard one: do not come across as borderline desperate in an interview. Even if you have been out of work for a while and really need the job, calibrate your enthusiasm to stay in the 'eager' lane. Companies want someone who wants to work for them, not someone eager to work just anywhere.
Have a list of questions ready to ask the people interviewing you. Write them down in advance in a notebook.
Do your homework on the company before being interviewed. In the case of a media company like ours, show that you have subscribed to our newsletter, have read some issues of it, and followed the daily news. Show that you have used the product, not just done the research.
Research pictures and videos of the company to familiarise yourself with its dress code. For an in-person interview, wear business casual rather than buying a new suit or dress. For remote working, you can be more yourself in the video interview.
If you have been freelancing for a long time or have changed jobs multiple times over a short period, reassure your interviewers you are not a 'flight risk'. Explain why it is you have decided to 'settle down'. Why now? And why with that company?
This is an advanced-level move: come with ideas! Suggest ways you could improve the company/product/service, the stories you would write, or the projects you would like to tackle - concrete ways to elevate what the company does.
Finally, do not be afraid to express your personality and outside work interests, though avoid getting into 'too much information' territory.

According to an internal memo seen by Citywire Selector, Becci McKinley-Rowe will remain as co-head of fundamental equities (FE) following Gamba's planned departure, which will take effect at the start of April, while Vasan will shift to share the responsibilities.
Vasan is currently deputy head of BlackRock's portfolio management group and has worked across fundamental and systematic investing, as well as covering US wealth advisory operations since he joined the firm in 2016.

Yakas is lead manager of the PS16.3m (EUR18.5m) Polar Capital Financial Opportunities
fund and co-manager of the PS520.8m (EUR590m) Polar Capital Global Financials Trust, which is UK domiciled.
Yakas joined Polar Capital in 2010, after working as a banker based in Hong Kong at HSBC. He has more than three decades' experience in the industry, having also worked as head of Asian research at Fox-Pitt Kelton (FPK), before it was acquired by Macquarie Group in 2009.

2023-02-14,a2409240,FTSE holds fresh high but US inflation disappoints,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Michelle Mcgagh,"The index steps back from the 8,000 mark as new data shows US inflation falling slower than hoped, though investors were buoyed by European Commission lifting its economic forecast for the EU.","Update: The FTSE 100 jumped to a record high as Europe looked set to skirt a recession, while mid-cap TUI (TUI) boosted travel stocks with further evidence of the return of holidaymakers.
The main UK index climbed 0.4% to a fresh high of 7,983 in the morning, putting the 8,000 milestone within reach after the European Commission upped its 2023 EU growth forecast to 0.8% from 0.3%, saying an easing in gas prices had helped the economic bloc.
However, it later gave away most of those gains, closing six points up at 7,953, after new US inflation figures disappointed, underlining the difficulty of solving cost-of-living pressures.
'Core consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% month-over-month, and the year-over-year rate ticked down to 5.55% versus 5.70%,' said Tiffany Wilding, Pimco's North American economist.
'However, after last week's annual seasonal factor revisions and basket weights update, US inflation now appears to be moderating more slowly than originally thought,' she added.
10.54: FTSE hits high, Europe avoids recession
Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'There have been pauses in limits set for spending and budget deficits since the pandemic, and these are now due to be reinstated.
'One of the biggest developments is that gas shortage fears have faded, which together with record low unemployment means economic contraction is less likely. The other positive needle in the haystack of geopolitical turmoil is that peak inflation is now behind the EU, according to the EU's economic commissioner.'
The news came ahead of this afternoon's US inflation figures for January, which may be pivotal in determining the speed and size of future interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve.
New data from the Office for National Statistics showed UK wages grew at 6.7% in the last quarter of 2022, but in real terms fell 3.6% due to inflation.
Vodafone (VOD) was the biggest blue-chip riser, up 3.2%, or 3p, to 97p after Liberty Global snapped up a 5% stake in the telecoms giant. The US group, chaired by billionaire John Malone, known as the 'cable cowboy', is betting on a recovery in the group after a slump in the shares.
'Liberty Global is essentially getting its foot in the door should any new deals start to emerge,' said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
'The company says the stake is only for investment purposes, but it's got form in seeking optionality for potential deals.'
He added: 'As a standalone business, Vodafone has struggle to generate any notable sales and earnings growth in recent years, and its share price performance has been truly miserable. Slowly, other players are planting their flags by investing in Vodafone with the market expectation that they will try and extract some value from the business.'
Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH), the soft drinks giant's bottling arm, fizzed 3% higher to PS20.01 despite consumer disappointment that Lilt will be pulled from production after 50 years and relaunched as Fanta Pineapple & Grapefruit.
The mid-cap domestically facing FTSE 250 gained 0.25%, or 49 points, at 20,173, buoyed by travel stocks after a positive first-quarter statement from holiday operator Tui.
TUI climbed 2.5%, or 4p, to 175p after reporting 3.3 million customers departed in the first quarter, a one million improvement from a year ago.
Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the group has 'not yet reached its preferred destination of profitability, but the damage wrought by the pandemic is being slowly undone'.
TUI shares have fallen 79% over the past five years, relegating it from the FTSE 100 in 2020, and there is still 'much work to do' to convince investors the recovery is becoming 'entrenched and sustainable', said Hunter.
Budget airlines took off in the favourable wind, with Easyjet (EZJ) rising 3.7%, or 17p, to 487p and Wizz Air (WIZZ) adding 1%, or 29p, to PS27.63.
Drax (DRX) was the biggest mid-cap climber, up 4.6%, or 29p, at 656p after JP Morgan raised its target price for the clean energy generator from 850p to 900p.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/ftse-holds-fresh-high-but-us-inflation-disappoints/a2409240,7

2023-02-14,a2409071,Revealed: the AMs with over 40% of active assets in sustainable funds,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,"BNP Paribas AM has nearly half of its actively managed, Europe-domiciled net assets in sustainable strategies - more than double the average among the top 20 players in the region.","Nearly half of BNP Paribas Asset Management's actively managed net assets in Europe are held in sustainable strategies - more than double the average among Europe's 20 largest active asset managers.
This is one of several findings from a Citywire Selector analysis of Morningstar Direct data, which examines how much of Europe's largest asset managers' net assets are held in ESG funds, as of 31 December 2022.
Taking open-ended funds and ETFs into account, Citywire Selector found the region's top names hold a combined EUR929bn in funds managed with ESG considerations out of a total EUR4.6tn European net assets.
On average, the asset managers offered 368 open-ended funds and ETFs each in Europe, of which 83 have been identified by Morningstar as sustainable funds.
Citywire's head of investment research, Frank Talbot, attributed the findings to the strong demand for sustainable products last year, even though European mutual funds and ETFs recorded their worst year of outflows since 2008.
'Funds labelled as sustainable had net inflows of EUR162bn, compared with outflows of EUR292bn from those without,' he said. 'This has resulted in sustainable products taking significant market share, and building upon the transfer of assets that ramped up in the pandemic.
'But why have the assets been gravitating towards these products? In 2020 and 2021, it was performance, but with that rally having subsided there is a cynical argument to be made that it is asset managers that are pushing these products, in an attempt to be seen to be putting capital to good use, rather than a large increase in investor demand.'
Zooming in on active
Focusing on actively managed funds offered in Europe, Citywire Selector found that sustainable strategies made up 22% of the asset managers' fund offerings on average. The average asset manager offered 287 Europe-domiciled active strategies, out of which 57 (19%) were sustainable.
The asset manager with the largest share of actively managed net assets in sustainable, Europe-domiciled funds is Irish banking and insurance group KBC Asset Management, where close to half (46.8%) of net assets are run under a sustainability mandate.
KBC told Citywire Selector that sustainability 'is not a subject of a separate strategy' but integrated into KBC's overall strategy, and emphasised that it has been one of the largest players in Belgium within responsible investing for over 30 years.
It launched the first responsible investment fund in Belgium in 1992 and was the first financial institution to have its own responsible investing research unit.
KBC is closely followed by BNP Paribas Asset Management (46%), Pictet Asset Management (42.7%) and UBS (41%).
Eric Borremans, head of ESG at Pictet Asset Management, said the firm did not have any targets aimed at increasing the share of assets held in sustainable funds.
The size of the firm's sustainable funds is linked to their commercial success owing to 'a combination of growing investor demand for such strategies and good performance results'.
The firm launched its water fund in 2000 and pioneered the development of thematic environmental strategies, according to Borremans.
How other firms fared
A BNP Paribas Asset Management spokesperson said the proportion of assets in sustainable mandates is 'not coincidental', as the firm has been involved in sustainable and responsible investment for over 20 years.
Similarly, a UBS Asset Management spokesperson referred to the group's earnings report, which states that sustainability has long been a firm-wide priority.
Of the 20 firms analysed, Swedbank Robur has the smallest share of sustainable net assets in its European active fund offering. Seven of its 71 Europe-domiciled active funds have been classified by Morningstar as sustainable, representing 3.3% (EUR3.4bn) of the firm's total actively managed net assets in the region.
'Each fund company is responsible to interpret and define what a sustainable investment is. We have integrated sustainability in our fund management since way back and work with the sustainability perspective in all of our funds, which is evident in the funds' information leaflets and reporting,' said Pia Gisgard, head of sustainability and governance at Swedbank.
She pointed to Morningstar's Fund Family 100 report, which shows that 87% of Swedbank's funds have been assigned a sustainability rating of 'above average' or 'high'.
Similarly, 3.9% of Franklin Templeton's actively managed net assets in Europe, which total EUR79.1bn, are held in sustainable funds. The asset manager offers 204 funds in the region, out of which 11 are sustainable strategies.
Pimco, Franklin Templeton and JP Morgan declined to comment.
Method
Citywire Selector asked Morningstar to identify the top 20 fund companies based on total net assets in Europe-domiciled funds and analyse the amount of assets in traditional funds as well as funds classified by Morningstar as sustainable.
Morningstar classifies funds as sustainable if they, by prospectus or other regulatory findings, claim to focus on sustainability, impact, or environmental, social, and governance factors.
ESG integrated funds - which formally consider ESG criteria in the investment progress and engagement with portfolio holdings but do not make ESG considerations the focus of the investment process - are not included in the category.
Included in the sample are Allianz Global Investors, Amundi, Axa, BlackRock, BNP Paribas Asset Management, Deka, DWS, Eurizon, Fidelity International, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, KBC, Nordea, Pictet, Pimco, Schroders, Swedbank, UBS and Union Investment.

2023-02-14,a2409240,FTSE hits fresh high as Europe avoids recession,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Michelle Mcgagh,"The index nears the 8,000 mark as the European Commission lifts its economic forecast for the EU, and Vodafone jumps after 'cable cowboy' John Malone takes a stake.","The FTSE 100 jumped to a record high as Europe looked set to skirt a recession, while mid-cap TUI (TUI) boosted travel stocks with further evidence of the return of holidaymakers.
The main UK index climbed 0.4% to a fresh high of 7,983, putting the 8,000 milestone within reach after the European Commission upped its 2023 EU growth forecast to 0.8% from 0.3%, saying an easing in gas prices had helped the economic bloc.
Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'There have been pauses in limits set for spending and budget deficits since the pandemic, and these are now due to be reinstated.
'One of the biggest developments is that gas shortage fears have faded, which together with record low unemployment means economic contraction is less likely. The other positive needle in the haystack of geopolitical turmoil is that peak inflation is now behind the EU, according to the EU's economic commissioner.'
The news came ahead of this afternoon's US inflation figures for January, which may be pivotal in determining the speed and size of future interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve.
New data from the Office for National Statistics showed UK wages grew at 6.7% in the last quarter of 2022, but in real terms fell 3.6% due to inflation.
Vodafone (VOD) was the biggest blue-chip riser, up 3.2%, or 3p, to 97p after Liberty Global snapped up a 5% stake in the telecoms giant. The US group, chaired by billionaire John Malone, known as the 'cable cowboy', is betting on a recovery in the group after a slump in the shares.
'Liberty Global is essentially getting its foot in the door should any new deals start to emerge,' said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.
'The company says the stake is only for investment purposes, but it's got form in seeking optionality for potential deals.'
He added: 'As a standalone business, Vodafone has struggle to generate any notable sales and earnings growth in recent years, and its share price performance has been truly miserable. Slowly, other players are planting their flags by investing in Vodafone with the market expectation that they will try and extract some value from the business.'
Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH), the soft drinks giant's bottling arm, fizzed 3% higher to PS20.01 despite consumer disappointment that Lilt will be pulled from production after 50 years and relaunched as Fanta Pineapple & Grapefruit.
The mid-cap domestically facing FTSE 250 gained 0.25%, or 49 points, at 20,173, buoyed by travel stocks after a positive first-quarter statement from holiday operator Tui.
TUI climbed 2.5%, or 4p, to 175p after reporting 3.3 million customers departed in the first quarter, a one million improvement from a year ago.
Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said the group has 'not yet reached its preferred destination of profitability, but the damage wrought by the pandemic is being slowly undone'.
TUI shares have fallen 79% over the past five years, relegating it from the FTSE 100 in 2020, and there is still 'much work to do' to convince investors the recovery is becoming 'entrenched and sustainable', said Hunter.
Budget airlines took off in the favourable wind, with Easyjet (EZJ) rising 3.7%, or 17p, to 487p and Wizz Air (WIZZ) adding 1%, or 29p, to PS27.63.
Drax (DRX) was the biggest mid-cap climber, up 4.6%, or 29p, at 656p after JP Morgan raised its target price for the clean energy generator from 850p to 900p.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/ftse-hits-fresh-high-as-europe-avoids-recession/a2409240,7

2023-02-14,a2409235,"Markets have PTSD after 2022, says EM debt veteran",Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Krystle Higgins,Tina Vandersteel on the Feds' current lack of credibility and why she's reluctant to buy Chinese sovereign debt.,"The jury is still out on whether the Federal Reserve can tackle inflation.
This is according to Tina Vandersteel who said that she and other investors feel jittery after a traumatic year.
'Watching the market's reaction to everything at the moment makes me think everyone has PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] from last year when risk assets were moving together in a really bad way.'
Vandersteels' comments come after what she described as a flip in correlation between risk-free rates and risky assets throughout last year, which impacted the emerging debt asset class.
Vandersteel told Citywire Selector she has not seen such a flip in decades.
'This is the first time since 1994 that you saw such a strong correlation where rates went up, causing spreads to go wider. Thirty years ago, the Fed really stuck it to the market and raised rates very quickly, and risk assets took it on the chin, so you got no diversification from your risk-free asset.
'Now with Fed funds where they are, we are in this tenuous place where on the one hand, Fed funds are very wide to the Fed's inflation target. It is just that they have not yet established the credibility that they will get back to a desired target.'
Vandersteel, who is Citywire A-rated, oversees a range of funds, including the EUR2bn GMO Emerging Country Debt
fund, which the US investment house launched as a Ucits-compliant version
in 2019.
Chinese debt
For Vandersteel, pricing power inevitably trumps macroeconomic events when it comes to portfolio construction, but she is still mindful of the latter.
Looking to China and more specifically Chinese debt, Vandersteel said she will not consider buying this asset class because of the country's reluctance to admit there is a risk attached.
'One of my favourite things to discuss about Chinese debt is that if you pull up the typical prospectus on Bloomberg or wherever you get your perspectives from, for any foreign currency bond there is a section called risk factors, which are pages long.
'However, in China there is not even one page detailing risk - there is just one sentence which basically tells investors this dollar is denominated in US dollars and therefore is subject to US interest rate fluctuations.'
For a country to repudiate its debt is very rare, added Vandersteel, who pointed to a paper written about the history of sovereign debt since the Battle of Waterloo. This details how China is one of the few countries to have done this after the revolution a century ago.
'It is one of a handful of countries to have ever repudiated its debt, but now its sovereign bond documents say there is no risk at all.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/markets-have-ptsd-after-2022-says-em-debt-veteran/a2409235,4

The AB Diversity Champions Equity Portfolio will invest in global companies aligned with at least one of three UN Sustainable Development Goals which promote gender equality, decent work and economic growth and reducing inequalities.
The fund, which will use the MSCI ACWI as a benchmark for performance, will be managed by Vivian Lubrano and Gayle Baldwin, who will use a proprietary six-pillar 'diversity champion assessment' to filter the portfolio.
The strategy, which is designed to 'capitalise on the long-term shift to a more diverse world', will be actively managed and use fundamental research to build a concentrated, high-conviction portfolio of companies. AB will engage on DEI issues with each portfolio company.
'Diversity champions' will be defined as issuers that capture the benefits of DEI and rank in the top half of all six pillars of the assessment.
Baldwin said: 'We are excited to launch this fund which is focused on the S in ESG. We are targeting companies strategically embracing the benefits of diversity, equity and inclusion.

2023-02-14,a2409182,When and why a Faang became a buy for a systematic value investor,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ian Heath,Texas-based giants Dimensional Advisors explain how Meta and other former hyper-growth tech stocks can become a value play for a quant-focused fund house.,"One of the great investment trends of the last decade has been the extraordinary growth of the tech-oriented Faang stocks.
The rapid rise of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google has seen them reach a combined market cap in excess of $3tn - more than 10% of the US stock market.
But are their best days behind them? And if so, is there a stage when their share prices could slump to an appealing level for value and systematic investors?
Citywire Selector spoke to Mamdouh Medhat, senior researcher and vice-president at Dimensional Fund Advisors, to find out.
Hold them on the way up
Research carried out by Dimensional Advisors, which is headquartered in Austin, Texas, has indicated that the best time to hold a US stock market giant is before it becomes one of the market-cap top 10, after which it tends to stagnate.
'Once they are already up there and at the very pinnacle of market capitalisation, they tend to perform in line with the market or even slightly underperform,' said Medhat.
'What you want to do is get stocks like that early when they're still relatively small and cheap. But it is very difficult to identify like that on a stock-by-stock basis.'
Medhat said the Faang stocks in particular had seen a 'phenomenal' assent to the top of the US stock market but were overvalued, like many tech stocks, by 2020.
'During the last decade, there were things that happened that were unexpected. For the Faangs the unexpected component was phenomenally positive for them.
'Then you had a pandemic where they skyrocketed in value even more because everybody was at home and using technology.
'From September 2010 until August 2020, they delivered an average annual return of around 35%. That level of return is just historically not seen before, especially for mega-caps like that. Expecting that going forward is unrealistic and not a sensible thing to do.'
Catch them on the way down
Last year was sobering for hyper-growth tech stocks, with former super-performers like Meta and Tesla dropping more than 60% in value from their 2021 peaks.
But for Dimensional, which operates a rules-based investing approach, the slump opened a window where Meta became of interest to its value-oriented portfolios.
'What is interesting is what we've seen happen for stocks like Tesla and Meta. A great example where you've seen Meta shooting up since it announced its latest earnings recently.
'Before that, Meta was pretty much unfavoured by many stock pickers. You had it going from the very top of the market as part of the Faang group, and then down to where it actually started to become interesting for an investor like us.'
Medhat said Dimensional's system, which overweights smaller, deeper value and higher profitability stocks, identified Meta as a value stock last year.
'Meta started becoming eligible to be included in some of our large-cap value portfolios because its valuation came down so much. It now became closer to the bottom 30% of price-to-book, which is our typical definition of value.
'That made it very interesting. While many others were selling, we started looking at it in a systematic way.'
Another metric of the Dimensional system is price momentum and Medhat explained that a window during August and September opened up when Meta became a buy opportunity.
'Meta had been in down momentum for quite some time but when it stopped being in the bottom 10% of losers and was in that value space, then we started going into it.
'We call this migration. Stocks can migrate from large-cap growth and down to small-cap value.'
He said that the Meta play demonstrated how quant funds have an advantage over index funds as metrics like momentum indicate better times to buy rather than just relying on stock price.
The Dimensional Global Value fund, which is sold across Europe, started the year with no Meta stock and ended with it as its fifth largest holding, with a 1.4% weighting among 720 stocks.
The fund is down 5.8% over the last year but is still the top-performing strategy in Citywire's Equity - Global Themes sector during that period.",https://citywireselector.com/news/when-and-why-a-faang-became-a-buy-for-a-systematic-value-investor/a2409182,1

2023-02-14,a2409150,Mandarine Gestion's founder: 'It's time to hand over',Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jeremie Gatignol,"With Mandarine Gestion set to be acquired by LFPI, Citywire France spoke to the value shop's founder Marc Renaud to find out more about the deal.","Marc Renaud, founder of Mandarine Gestion and industry veteran of 35 years, is preparing to hand over the reins of his boutique to independent multi-strategy specialist LFPI.
He spoke to Selector's sister publication Citywire France about the decision.
For about 30 minutes he spoke candidly about the reasons for the deal, his attachment to his company and his vision for the profession.
LFPI has announced that it has entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire Mandarine Gestion. Can you tell us more?
Marc Renaud: I've been looking for the right partner for some time to hand over. We have been in high demand for a few years and last year we commissioned a bank to speed up the process. LFPI is the buyer we selected because it met our criteria.
The price, obviously, is essential, but above all else was the alignment of interests and the complementary nature of the two companies. Mandarine Gestion is an entrepreneurial company and majority owned by its managers and employees. We were looking for a solution to keep the employees involved.
I wanted to find a company that resembles us and ensures real synergies, where each entity will contribute to make the whole bigger. This is the history and meaning of Mandarine Gestion. The company's customers are here because of this DNA.
Capital ownership of Mandarine Gestion at the end of 2022
Managers and employees: 66%
Arkea: 13%
Banque Postale: 12%
Financiere Dassault: 9%
What does this deal mean to you?
I'm 64 years old and I think it's time to step down. I am taking part in the transition because LFPI asked me to and I was in no hurry to leave. But the idea is for me to stop. I don't want to resume activities once the transition is complete, apart from being a bit of a business angel, for example, but in small doses. The goal is to travel and make time for my loved ones. In short, it will be retirement, a little after turning 64.
What about other shareholders?
We have a shareholders' agreement which assumes that the conditions proposed by LFPI apply to everyone. Everyone will have to position themselves, but LFPI's objective is a majority takeover.
We read in the press that Arkea intends to sell back its stake in LFPI and repatriate EUR850m it entrusted to Mandarine to manage.
It's up to Arkea to talk about it. The only thing I can say on this subject is that the EUR850m they initially brought in during 2017 has melted a little. This is to be expected because over the past five years it has been especially global and thematic stocks that have been sought by investors. If Arkea repatriates the remaining AUM sitting in its group, we will do things on good terms. I am also counting on promising fundraising prospects to emerge and developments brought about by the LFPI purchase to stabilise our funds.
How will Mandarine evolve post-transition?
It is precisely so I no longer have to ask myself these questions that I am selling my shares! More seriously, the agreement we are putting in place is an agreement for growth and development synergies, not cost reduction. Mandarine will continue with its management style.
We have adopted global and thematic management and we must continue. Our presence in certain European markets will help the new entity to develop and our combined sales forces will have more strings to their bows to address old and new customers. I am confident for the future.
Who will take over the management of your value funds?
Yohan Salleron, who is number two in value management and who has accompanied me since the creation of Mandarine, will gradually take over my responsibilities as a manager. He has solid experience, clients know him and I have full confidence in his management skills.
Can you share with us your vision for the evolution of the asset management industry?
I could launch into a long speech on the future role of artificial intelligence in our professions and how it will transform them and perhaps one day replace us. But I'll leave that for the youngest among us to do.
In the shorter term, the question of profitability will arise. It was strong more than 10 years ago and still comfortable today, but it is inexorably declining. Concentration is inevitable, in particular, because a generation is leaving and handing over control, but also for issues of regulatory costs and the race for critical mass.
ETFs will also continue to take market share. However, there will always be a place for quality active management and people who are ready to get started. The advantage of this industry is that it does not require capital. On the other hand, we need seed capital and we can no longer launch the way we used to because compliance is so much heavier. But one must try. It's a fabulous industry and young people with ambition must do it.",https://citywireselector.com/news/mandarine-gestion-s-founder-it-s-time-to-hand-over/a2409150,3
2023-02-14,a2409232,Why small caps offer value in a 'choose-your-own-adventure' story,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Daniel Ruiz,"SMEs were the first to be hit by sticky inflation and reacting central banks, but a more optimistic view of the market now makes lower valuations look attractive to PMs.","Small caps are usually the first to be hit by a risk-off attitude in the market, and when inflation started to pick up a few months ago and central banks acted to contain it, the rule held true.
However, many portfolio managers believe the worst is behind us, and with lower valuations in sight, they now see attractive entry points.
'You hear a slightly more optimistic tone from companies. I don't think people have an overarching view, that this is kind of a 2009 redux. I'm not a value guy, but there's some pretty good values out there' said Goldman Sachs manager Greg Tuorto.
Tuorto, who oversees the $90m Goldman Sachs Small Cap Equity fund, believes the market was too pessimistic last year.
'You had the average TV market commentator, who just kind of spits stuff out talking about earnings and revenue. There was in anticipation there'd be large negative revisions to these, but it did not happen to that degree,' Tuorto said.
The Global Small/Mid-Cap Equity sector saw net outflows of EUR1.35bn over the first 11 months of 2022. However, inflows of EUR1.31bn in December alone compensated for such losses. That is the largest inflow for the sector on record, according to Morningstar.
Rob Lanphier, partner and portfolio specialist of US growth and core equity at William Blair Investment Management, echoes this view and expects a rebound in the market.
'If one believes that the US economy will bottom out in the next 12 to 18 months, it is very likely, in our opinion, that the stock market could react positively six to nine months earlier. This suggests that we could see a material recovery before the end of 2023.
'One particularly interesting observation is that during the last six US recessions, going back to 1980, almost immediately upon entering a recession, smaller caps outperformed large caps for the next three years, without exception,' said Lanphier.
Shopping for bargains
Lanphier believes pricing flexibility will be a critical factor amid higher interest rates and peaking inflation looking forward.
'This scenario spells certain pressure on margins and likely earnings disappointments for the average company. Higher quality investments generally did not outperform for much of 2022, resulting in compelling valuations for these businesses as we look ahead,' he said.
During 2022, Goldman's Tuorto divested a substantial amount of software stocks as many of these companies weren't going to have the previously estimated near-term profitability, so he pivoted away and focused on revenue and free cashflow.
He also reduced financials: 'People thought there'd be a very large net interest margin opportunity but, honestly, that hasn't happened. Not only has it been difficult to attract deposits, but also expensive.
'Consumer lending dried up very quickly, so those twin headwinds made it a little bit more complicated to be aggressively positioned in the financial space.'
The manager turned instead to industrials as well as defence and aerospace companies, to capture the 'revenge travel' coming back after the pandemic.
Lanphier believes earnings fundamentals look solid, with the most recent reported quarter providing insights into the strength of earnings growth across all market caps.
'Relative to large caps, smaller caps are seeing stronger absolute earnings growth with a wider gap between actual and consensus estimates,' he said.
Still, Tuorto is aware of the risks attached to these stocks: 'Investing in small caps is many times like a choose-your-own-adventure book but, especially in this case, quality is in the eye of the beholder.'
The manager believes the inefficiencies in the market and, on many occasions, the lack of absolute conviction about certain investments, creates paralysis among investors, which in turn represents an opportunity.
'In the large-cap world, you could probably learn 80% of what you need about a company to be highly convicted to start a position. In the small-cap world, if you get to 50 or 60%, you need to kind of deliver a decision, because there's a lot of unknowns.
'You must have a little more judgement and say: ""I may be wrong, but I've done enough work to assume that I'm not going to be that wrong"" and move on.'
Private equity and M&A
Tuorto is surprised that strategic M&A activity has been very quiet over the past year, with larger companies staying away from acquiring smaller peers.
'I think that they're a little concerned about some of the regulatory burden that they would have to assume and that may be a headwind.
'But the big difference is that private equity M&A has bumped up significantly. We've seen a lot of it in software, industrials, aerospace and defence, and consumer is starting to bubble up a bit.'
He believes there's a lot of capacity and pent-up demand: 'For now, the private equity players are going to be the ones that kind of rule the field, in terms of looking for consolidation opportunities.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/why-small-caps-offer-value-in-a-choose-your-own-adventure-story/a2409232,2
2023-02-15,a2409366,EUR15tn investor coalition takes on meat industry over labour conditions,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,A Fairr-led engagement coalition is urging meatpacking companies to improve working conditions to combat labour shortages.,"An investor coalition involving 77 firms with $16tn (EUR14.9tn) in combined assets is calling out seven of the world's largest meat companies for failing to improve working conditions and backtracking on progress made during the Covid-19 pandemic.
In an engagement progress report, which was published by the investor network Fairr, said target companies - Tyson Foods, JBS USA, WH Group, Marfrid, BRF, Sanderson Farms, and Cranswick - show 'a lack of prioritisation of workers' voices' that is already impacting production and profits.
The report shows that six out of seven companies weakened or repealed sick pay benefits introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic, with Tyson Foods being the only company to implement permanent sick pay provision.
However, paid sick days are not available to 89% of Tyson Food's frontline meatpacking staff, who have zero-hour contracts.
Additionally, only one of the seven companies publicly disclose metrics on the number of subcontracted workers they employ despite the risk of forced labour resulting from precarious contracts.
Meat giant JBS was caught in a child labour scandal last year after a cleaning subcontractor was found to have illegally employed dozens of minors to clean the meat plants.
Fairr's report said, instead of addressing structural challenges such as health and safety in a way that can attract new workers, companies are increasing their employment of refugee and migrant workers, who are more vulnerable to exploitative labour conditions, without implementing additional controls to mitigate the human rights risk.
Despite widespread labour shortages in the industry, with US job postings for meatpacking workers rising by 86% between 2017 and 2021, Tyson Foods is the only company in the engagement campaign to have recognised labour shortages as a business risk.
The report also highlighted Marfrig as the most-improved company in the engagement, following its improvement in disclosure regarding grievance mechanisms, sick pay, distribution of workforce across employment contract types, and worker representation.
Jeremy Coller, chair and founder of Fairr and chief investment officer of Coller Capital, said Fairr investor members are increasingly concerned by the financial risks associated with poor working conditions in many of the leading global meat producers.
'Poor working conditions disrupt operations, erode health and safety standards and are a clear financial risk for investors in meat companies. During Covid, the meat sector stepped up to address labour risks, however many of these improved policies have been reversed,' said Coller.
Juan Salazar, senior engagement specialist at Pictet Asset Management, said labour rights issues can represent a material operational, legal and reputational risk to meat producers.
'Many meat producers reacted at the height of the pandemic to provide sick pay and other incentives to workers, but most are failing to make these changes stick. Investor action on working conditions in the meat industry should not falter as the threat from the pandemic reduces.

Azoulay launched the new business in the wake of her former employer, Lutetia Capital, announcing in January that it would stop providing fund selection efforts and cease running third-party assets.
The former JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs banker had spent 12 years in Lutetia Capital's Paris office. She was most recently head of investment advisory, having initially joined in 2010 to oversee its international efforts.
Azoulay will work as chief executive of Front Row and seek to capitalise on her work in international markets by citing foreign family investors, such as those based in Cyprus and the Middle East.
Speaking to Citywire France, Azoulay said she would not exclusively offer advice on private assets, as she will also cover public investments through partner funds and in-house strategies.
The aim is to launch a US-based fund-of-funds strategy in the first quarter of 2023, which will focus on emerging technology ideas, largely drawn from the West Coast of the country. As Front Row is not a management company, it will work with an AIFM-registered firm to provide management responsibilities.",https://citywireselector.com/news/french-fund-selector-launches-multi-family-office-venture/a2409390,1
2023-02-15,a2409394,Fidelity splits EMEA fund to separate off Russian assets,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Caroline Hug,"Russian holdings will remain in the original strategy, while Fidelity houses the other assets in a new Sustainable Emerging Markets Equity fund.","Fidelity is splitting the assets of its Emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) fund.
Following a shareholder vote on 8 February, the assets of the EMEA fund will be divided, leaving only Russian holdings in the fund.
Investors in the EMEA strategy will continue to hold shares in the fund, but will also receive an equal number of shares in the newly created Fidelity Sustainable Emerging Markets Equity (SEME) fund.
The step follows similar moves by Schroders and JP Morgan to split their Emerging Europe funds, separating off the Russian exposure.
In March 2022, Fidelity soft-closed its EMEA fund to new investments due to liquidity issues following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The strategy, managed by Nick Price and Greg Konstantinidis, had an 8.6% exposure to Russia, with Russian energy giant Gazprom listed under its top 10 holdings.
The firm had hoped to rebrand it as the Fidelity Sustainable Emerging Markets fund. It planned for it to join its range of sustainable funds to ensure at least 70% of its funds' portfolios were invested in companies with strong sustainability characteristics.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, however, the fund's performance was hit badly, with the performance down 37.3% over the three months to the end of February 2022.
Both of the portfolio managers subsequently lost their Citywire AAA ratings in March.
Price said subsequently that he had 'underestimated both the likelihood and the impact of the invasion' when Russia moved troops into Ukraine last February.
The asset split is due to take place on 24 March, with shares in the new SEME fund available three days later, from 27 March.
Following the split, investors will no longer be able to buy or sell shares in the EMEA fund, which will be closed. Russian assets will be sold with the aim of returning value to shareholders.
A spokesperson from Fidelity said: 'Existing Russian holdings will remain in the EMEA fund, effectively making it an ""external side pocket"".
'Non-Russian holdings will either be transferred to the new SEME Fund or sold down to cash, with the balance transferred to the new fund. The SEME fund will then initiate exposure to additional selected emerging markets companies that we believe maintain strong sustainability characteristics.
'Going forward, the new Fidelity Sustainable Emerging Markets Equity fund will have a new and differentiated investment policy to the EMEA fund, with a more concentrated portfolio of 30-50 holdings.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/fidelity-splits-emea-fund-to-separate-off-russian-assets/a2409394,5
2023-02-15,a2409495,Rathbones' David Coombs: Why I sold my last gilts two weeks ago,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jeremy Gordon,David Coombs believes that there is no longer any chance of picking up UK debt at attractive yields for his Rathbones Multi-Asset portfolio.,"Rathbones Multi-Asset portfolio manager David Coombs has sold his remaining gilts, arguing the opportunity to pick up UK government bonds at attractive yields has closed.
UK government and corporate bonds slumped to distressed levels in late September as the market revolted against a huge package of unfunded tax cuts in then chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's disastrous 'mini'-Budget.
A more than 150 basis points (bps), or 1.5%, rise in the 30-year gilt yield over three trading days set off a chain of events that ended Liz Truss' premiership - but also gave fixed income and multi-asset investors the chance to lock in the highest yields for years.
While Coombs pounced on that opportunity after having 'almost no bonds in our funds for a long time', he believes the recovery has now run its course.
'I've stopped buying credit since October,' he told Citywire last Friday. 'I sold all my gilts last week.'
While already a reduced position in the Rathbones Multi-Asset Portfolios he runs, the catalyst for Coombs to sell his 10-year gilts was yields falling below 3% - down from 4.5% in late September and early October.
Since that low on 2 February, the 10-year yield has quickly moved back up to 3.5%.
'I bought a whole load of corporate bonds in October post the Kwasi Kwarteng-debacle... and bought a lot of bonds below par that I'm probably going to hold to maturity,' said Coombs.
'But if I was creating a new fund today, I'd buy no corporate bonds, no high yield and no government bonds in the UK.'
For the manager, who is in charge of about PS3bn of assets in Rathbones' main multi-asset fund range, that is partly a matter of preference rather than bearishness on UK debt specifically.
The funds do not usually invest in corporate bonds, particularly investment grade, as Coombs feels they rarely offer enough long-term growth and can prove volatile. He added that parts of the market, including sterling credit, are fundamentally illiquid.
'You buy bonds when everyone hates them,' he said.
In October, the manager says he was able to buy bonds well below the bid price - locking in higher yields - as ETFs and US investors were dumping sterling credit.
'I only buy corporate bonds when there's distress,' he explained. 'In October there was a lot of distress so I was getting called all the time.'
Across fixed income markets, one of the few areas where Coombs sees potential value is in short-duration US government bonds. He pointed to US two-year Treasuries, yielding 4.6% at the time of writing versus core inflation at just over 6% and coming down.
'Don't get me wrong, it's not wildly exciting,' he said, but added that underlying exposure to a 'risk-off currency' in the dollar was another pro.
In the diversifiers portion of portfolios where bonds sit, Rathbones have been relying more on put options as a hedge against equity market falls.
Robert Alster, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, agreed that recovery opportunity in UK fixed income is essentially over and is unlikely to be repeated soon, given the focus of Rishi Sunak's government on fiscal control and regaining credibility.
'You had your moment for two or three weeks,' Alster said. 'You either acted or you didn't and I'm afraid it's now back to looking at other areas of the market really.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/rathbones-david-coombs-why-i-sold-my-last-gilts-two-weeks-ago/a2409495,1
2023-02-15,a2409325,'Investor anxiety' flags: How this AAA-rated manager got ahead of the curve on value,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ian Heath,"Liontrust's Samantha Gleave says her data-driven, cashflow investment methodology told her to invest in contrarian stocks in 2020 and indicated tech was 'not a very safe place'.","Many investors were caught out in 2022, as stocks and bonds were both negatively hit in a 12-month period many will wish to forget.
Samantha Gleave, who manages cashflow funds at Liontrust, is among the minority who stood out as others struggled to find their feet.
Gleave and her co-manager James Inglis-Jones are the second-best-performing managers in the Equity - Europe ex-UK sector on a three-year total return basis for their work on the Liontrust European Dynamic Fund .
The duo returned 40.2% over the period to December 2022, while the average fund in the 116-strong peer group returned 9.9%. The duo also co-manage the long/short Liontrust GF European Strategic Equity fund, which sits 9th out of 184 strategies over the same timeframe, and the Liontrust GF European Smaller Companies Fund , which is sold across Europe.
Gleave said the firm's five-stage 'cashflow champions' data-driven process prompted an early and widespread move into value stocks, which was undertaken well ahead of many of their contemporaries.
'In 2020, we had a very big message from stage four in our investment process, which is the market regime indicators, telling us to buy contrarian value stocks,' she said.
'We haven't seen many contrarian value opportunities come across the market over the years. We'd seen it in the previous 10 years in one or two sectors, but not overall at the market level.'
Anxious markets
Gleave said some of the key indicators within the system assess investor and corporate behaviour, drawing on metrics such as valuation spreads, stock volatility, investor appetite and capital expenditure.
A high level of market nervousness was detected in the summer of 2020. 'We knew investor anxiety was really high, and we knew from historic evidence that's when value stocks start to perform,' she said.
'If you don't have this kind of framework and evidence in place, then it would be quite difficult to for investors to genuinely pick it up, but that was the time to switch.'
Gleave said the system advised moving into 'contrarian value' in a broad number of sectors. 'There were financials, consumer discretionary and automotive companies ticking those boxes,' she explained. 'It wasn't just confined to one or two sectors. That was the nature of the Covid crisis. It was a global pandemic, where no industries could really escape.
'Perhaps the exception was tech stocks, which became even more expensive and crowded as a lot of investors thought they were a flight to safety. Our regime indicators were telling us that was not a very safe place to be.
'We started to tilt our portfolios towards value in 2020 and value has worked well over the last two years after a very long period of significant underperformance.'
Gleave said two examples of deep value stocks she bought at the time were Bank of Ireland and Pandora.
'In the case of Bank of Ireland, at the time of purchase the shares were trading at a very wide discount to tangible book value despite a solid balance sheet. Since then, the stock has taken on more recovering value characteristics,' she said.
'Similarly, Pandora, the jewellery retail company was purchased on a very low valuation. Today, the stock has good momentum characteristics and is returning cash to shareholders via dividends and a recently announced new share buyback programme. We continue to hold both stocks in our funds.'
Five stage 'cashflow champions' process:
Identify the investment universe, for example by region.
Apply two primary cash flow ratios, which are the 'quality' reflecting cashflow-over-assets, and 'value' which is cashflow-over-market cap. The two ratios are added together. Liontrust only invests in the 20% best scoring stocks, which are called the Cashflow Champions.
Further due diligence on the top 20%. Screens called secondary scores are applied. Each stock gets a score across four criteria: momentum, cash return, recovering value and contrarian value.
Market regime indicators. Market signals are layered onto the portfolio, for instance to buy contrarian value stocks.
Portfolio construction. Concentration, weighting etc.
Where are we now?
Gleave said their investment data was still indicating that the 'market is not in cheap territory'. 'A lot of growth stocks are not yet cheap,' she said. 'They're still sitting at a valuation that is above the long-term average.
'Some growth stocks, given the fall that they had in the last 18 months or so, look less expensive. Something like Tesla has fallen an awfully long way from its peak back in 2021. But it's not yet looking like a really attractive cashflow champion.'
In terms of positioning, she said her funds still have 'relatively low exposure' to the market. 'The message is relatively concentrated portfolios on the long side,' she outlined. 'They will be the cashflow champions with the most attractive characteristics and a couple of really good secondary scores, such as momentum, recovery value or cash return.
'On the short side, we actually have quite a different approach. A very diversified short book, and typically between 150 to 200 positions. What we're looking to do is exploit styles and short stocks with certain characteristics, such as poor cash flow and expensive cash flow valuations.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/investor-anxiety-flags-how-this-aaa-rated-manager-got-ahead-of-the-curve-on-value/a2409325,5

2023-02-15,a2409371,"FTSE breaks through 8,000 on inflation cheer",Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Michelle Mcgagh,"FTSE 100 briefly breaches 8,000 mark on hopes falling inflation will see central banks ease up on interest rate rises. Scottish Mortgage, the fallen grobal growth fund, leads the rally.","The FTSE 100 briefly broke past the 8,000 mark this afternoon for the first time in history as investor optimism around a peak in inflation came to a head, with global growth fund Scottish Mortgage leading the charge higher.
After recovering from an early fall (see below), the UK's main stock market index hit 8,002 after 3.30pm but slipped back to close at 7,998, up 0.6%, or 44 points, on the day. It has gained nearly 6% this year.
In a volatile 12 months, the blue-chip benchmark fell below 7,000 last March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and slid back to a 12-month low of 6,826 in October after the 'mini'-Budget upset markets with its uncosted tax cuts.
Today's rally was sparked by a small but better-than-expected decline in UK inflation to 10.1% in January. This caused the pound to fall 1.2% to $1.2017 against the dollar - on the expectation of fewer interest rate rises from the Bank of England - which boosted shares in the FTSE's big multinational by lifting the value of their dollar earnings.
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said easing inflation 'paves the way for central banks to introduce some slack when it comes to monetary tightening'.
'The UK's inflation reading has been an important milestone given wider concerns about the country's particularly harsh report card from the International Monetary Fund recently,' she said.
Scottish Mortgage (SMT ), the Baillie Gifford flagship investment trust that has halved in the growth selloff provoked by rising inflation and interest rates, flew 4%, or 29p, to 468p to the top of the leader board.
Stocks that will benefit from a softer economic landing also pushed higher, with housebuilder Persimmon (PSN) up 2.8% at PS14.50 and Premier Inn owner Whitbread (WTB) adding 2.7% to trade at PS18.77.
Gambling groups also benefited with Entain (ENT) up 3.7% at PS13.69 and Flutter (FLTR) adding 2.5% to trade at PS131.00.
10.10: FTSE steadies as inflation falls to 10.1%
The FTSE 100 recovered from an early fall after UK inflation fell a little more than expected in January, but a disappointing share buyback from Barclays (BARC) and a top-line revenue miss from miner Glencore (GLEN) stopped the blue-chip index from rallying.
After dipping 0.39%, or 31 points, to 7,922, the FTSE rose to trade unchanged at 7,953 after the Office for National Statistics reported inflation fell to 10.1% in January from 10.5% in December, a steeper fall than anticipated, as the continued fall in petrol prices helped to lower the cost of living. Business costs also rose more slowly thanks to falls in the price of electricity and oil.
The pound weakened at the prospect of fewer interest rate rises from the Bank of England, sliding 0.6% to $1.2094 against the dollar, while gilt yields slipped across the board, lifting the price of UK government bonds.
While the fall in the cost of living is a positive, UK inflation is still ahead of US inflation, which this week was revealed to have eased for a seventh consecutive month in January, to 8.5%.
Royal London Asset Management senior economist Melanie Baker said that, despite the falls, 'inflation still looks strong' and the Bank of England was likely to implement further rate hikes.
'I still expect further rate hikes from the Bank this year while domestically driven inflation looks strong, but this data in isolation looks more consistent with a pause for now,' she said.
Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, said the inflation data would have been met 'with a sigh of relief in Threadneedle Street that the inflation picture is finally starting to improve'.
However, he warned that investors should 'not read too much into one month of data' as inflation is still strong and further rate hikes remain necessary.
'We see interest rates of 4.5% as the minimum required to return inflation to target over the coming quarters,' Gimber said. The base rate currently stands at 4% after the Bank's 0.5 percentage point hike this month.
Barclays was the biggest FTSE faller, sliding 7.6%, or 14p, to 172p after a PS500m share buyback failed to placate investors over profits before tax sliding 14% in 2022 to PS7bn, impacted by impairment charges, a weakening economic outlook, and the PS1.6bn cost of litigation relating to the mis-selling of US securities.
NatWest (NWG) and Lloyds (LLOY) fell more than 2% in sympathy.
Swiss commodity and mining group Glencore shed 2.9%, or 14p, to 501p after full-year revenue missed expectations despite increasing 26% to $256bn. Adjusted profits soared 60% to $34.1bn, smashing the previous year's record of $21.3bn, with the company dishing out $7.1bn, or PS5.9bn, to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.
Matt Britzman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'The top line may have missed market expectations, but Glencore's taking full advantage of a messy energy market to line its coffers, and there's good news for shareholders as they get to share in the spoils, with a topped-up dividend and fresh $1.5bn buyback.'
Glencore's fall dragged its mining and commodity peers lower. Anglo American (AAL) was down 2.1%, or 70p, at PS31.42.
Antofagasta (ANTO) down 1.9%, or 32p, at PS16.70.
Rio Tinto (RIO) down 1.5%, or 91p, at PS59.27.
Endeavour Mining (EDV) down 0.9%, or 17p, at PS18.30.
Fresnillo (FRES) down 0.8%, or 6p, at 786p.
The more domestically-focused FTSE 250 ticked higher, eked into the black with a 0.15%, or 30 points, increase to trade at 20,048.
Bakkavor Group (BAKK) led the mid-caps higher, gaining 2.2%, or 2p, to 111p, after HSBC raised its target price for the food manufacturing group from 99.5p to 100.4p.
Dunelm (DNLM) pushed 1.5%, or 18p, higher to PS11.87, after the home furnishing retailer stuck to its forecasts despite profits tumbling 16% in the 26 weeks to 31 December as post-pandemic demand eased and inflation soared.

It was the year the elastic snapped on valuations that had become wildly overstretched, particularly among those companies not yet turning a profit.
Investors learned to their cost that valuations matter. Many may have to rethink some of the ideas that have served them well over the past decade.
Multiple dangers
Shareholder returns come from earnings, dividends and the changing multiple attached to earnings. That third element is what crushed many investors last year.
The ratio of price to earnings, also known as the P/E multiple, tells you how investors perceive a company - its likely growth in earnings and the likely volatility and sustainability of those earnings. What is happening in the economy, particularly what is happening to interest rates, can also affect perceptions. As the mood waxes and wanes so does the multiple of earnings people are willing to pay, and therefore valuations. Sometimes markets become unrealistically optimistic or gloomy. The past couple of years have given plenty of reasons to be both.
Covid-19 hurt many companies - think airlines and restaurant chains - but benefited others. Lockdowns around the world began in March 2020. Suddenly lots of people wanted gym equipment at home. Shares in exercise company Peloton, which offered not just bikes but online classes, went on sale at $29 when the company was floated in September 2019. By Christmas 2020 they were trading on a multiple of nearly 100 times expected earnings. The shares had risen more than fivefold to $162 in just 15 months - despite the company having yet to make a profit!
Other businesses also enjoyed a big lockdown homeworking bonanza. They included Zoom, Amazon, Microsoft and JustEat.
Investors started talking about a 'new normal' - always a sell signal in my book. They claimed these companies had not just seen a spike in earnings but that it would be permanent. We would never go back to the gym or the shops; we would conduct all meetings by video; and we would not just order evening takeaways on JustEat - we would order breakfast as well.
Mid-2021 saw peak craziness - and then in autumn inflation began to bite. As central banks lifted interest rates, reality crept in. Earnings did not carry on rising sharply. Heavily indebted companies that had borrowed to leverage growth looked less appealing with a recession looming and loan costs rising.
As the economic cycle turned, Peloton's ride came to a sticky end. With the company still losing money, its shares today are down to $16. Lots of other companies experienced a similar rise and fall. Investors who got hurt on the way may now be questioning their beliefs. This is healthy.
Do you have to buy and hold?
One mantra of the quantitative easing era worth reviewing is 'buy and hold'. There is much to be said for buying and holding companies, running winners, and keeping transaction costs down. But if you are focused on valuations you need to act when multiples become stretched. And in more volatile markets short-lived opportunities occur. If you can make 20% quickly on an underpriced stock, harvest it and cut it when the price recovers, this can significantly affect total returns. Portfolio turnover need not go crazy, but it may rise somewhat when market volatility rises.
Questioning growth and value
In the decade following the 2008/09 financial crisis - the era of quantitative easing and astonishingly low interest rates - investors often became obsessed with terms like 'growth' and 'value'. Growth investors looked for companies growing rapidly - even if at enormous cost. They managed to ignore the fact that many of these companies were making a loss. Profits would come in abundance later, they believed. As momentum built behind these growth stocks and valuations rose, people started thinking less about dividends and more about capital returns.
A value investor, on the other hand, was often seen as someone who scrabbled around in the bargain basement, looking for cheap companies that paid a dividend. These more mature companies tended to stay cheap, though, so their share prices were becalmed in comparison with the exciting growth companies soaring on the rocket fuel of cheap debt.
Growth bad, value good?
The return of inflation, rising interest rates and quantitative tightening turned these ideas upside down. Did that make growth bad and value good?
Although dividends are likely to become a bigger part of future total returns, it is dangerous to invest just in the highest-dividend-yielding companies. They often end up being value traps: companies whose prospects are permanently impaired and whose dividends will likely be cut in future.
Meanwhile, it is possible to find companies viewed as growth stocks selling at much more realistic and attractive valuations - though many have rebounded recently.
Do you want to miss out on the best of the growth and value stories in the year ahead when things are so changeable?
The simple lesson is not to get too tied to a specific investment approach or macro forecast. Diversification has always been good for growing and safeguarding your wealth. That should mean diversifying your investment styles, too.

2023-02-15,a2409261,How Pimco's Andrew Balls views beta after a 'grim year' for markets,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,The asset manager's cyclical outlook focuses on active opportunities in a world where fixed income may prove a more fruitful hunting ground.,"Pimco's Andrew Balls believes core bond allocations could play a pivotal part in multiple portfolios over the coming year, as investors rally from a 'grim year' driven largely by beta.
Speaking to Citywire Selector, Balls, who is CIO for global fixed income at the asset manager, said financial markets were now factoring in more favourable outcomes, especially as concerns over a lengthy and damaging recession appeared to be declining.
'I don't think it matters too much if we have a technical recession or not. We are going to have a slowdown compared with where we had forecast global growth to be at the end of last year. We have had some upside outcomes in terms of the data that has come out recently and that has reduced concerns about a more significant recession.
'Financial markets are now priced for a slightly more favourable outcome. There are many things to consider in a recessionary environment, but at a portfolio level we need to be conscious of how to protect against the worst-case scenarios.
'We have done that by upping the quality in our bond portfolios and in terms of our credit positions. We can get pretty reasonable yields and investment grade looks more attractive than high yield,' he added.
Wary of consensus
Balls, who co-authored the group's most recent cyclical outlook paper with economist Tiffany Wilding, said it was hard to overlook the impact of inflation on allocation ideas. He said this remained a topic that must be considered 'very seriously' and that Pimco was refraining from adopting the growing consensus around disinflation.
'The market has moved to something of a disinflationary viewpoint but we are not using that as our baseline. There is also a lot of talk about what happens if, and when, the Fed starts to talk about the need to tighten again, which is something else to consider when thinking over the longer term.
'If we were to talk about front-end rate exposure, we are pricing in a range of scenarios, as this area is one which is likely to come under pressure if the Fed was to move to a situation where it was talking about cutting - rather than raising - rates, in the near future.'
Looking at market dynamics, Balls said beta-driven opportunities must be considered, given the impact beta positioning had on returns in 2022.
'We are continuing to see the impact of the need to be active and unearth quality after what was a quite grim year. We have seen that there was a strong correlation between bonds and equities, as beta carried most of the market. Now, we are moving to a situation where yields look quite attractive and we could see that correlation changing.
'There is a strong case for the core bond allocations, such as global bonds and US aggregate, where you are starting to see opportunities where yields are in excess of 5%. This comes after a period where yields have been compressed to historically low levels but now you can more readily see opportunities where you would get 4-5%.'
Balls added that adding credit duration risk could generate yields of 6-7%, which is miles above what has been achievable in recent years. 'So, we are starting to talk about a 5% yield at a time when equities are at the end of a bull run. We have said in our outlook that bonds are back. Market pricing, to us at least, looks pretty reasonable in light of how central banks have acted and how they are likely to proceed.'
Keeping something back
In the cyclical outlook, Pimco referenced the need to retain 'dry powder' as markets evolve and change. Balls clarified these comments are referring to broad risk budgets, rather than cash or cash equivalents in portfolios.

2023-02-15,a2409320,Inside this elite China equity PM's plans for post-Covid positioning,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,Richard Pan has tweaked his regional specific strategy to capture winners from the country's reopening.,"China's reopening to the wider economic world is likely to be a major theme for the year ahead. And Richard Pan is already tailoring his JSS Equity - All China
fund to take advantage.
Pan, who works for China AMC and co-runs the fund on mandate for the Swiss asset manager with his colleague David Lin, made a host of revisions to the portfolio over the final period of 2022, as he looked at the opportunities that the end of 'zero Covid' could create.
'We made several sector adjustments in 2022 Q4 with the main purpose to capture the re-opening rally and re-position the fund in the post-Covid regime,' he said in emailed comments to Citywire.
'In particular, we increased positions in communication services, consumer discretionary, and real estate, all of which are among the first wave of re-opening beneficiaries. However, our long-term views remains the same: we are still positive on renewable energy, high-end manufacturing, and consumer upgrade in the long run,' Pan said.
'We remained underweight in consumer cyclicals during most of 2022, due to little exposure of ecommerce companies for regulation risk concerns. The allocation started to pick up in Q4 and currently we are slightly overweight this sector.'
The $341m Luxembourg-domiciled fund currently has 22.5% exposed to consumer discretionary stocks, which is the largest sector allocation, while communications (13%) and real estate (3.9%) account for smaller levels of exposure, according to the fund's December factsheet.
The real estate exposure, while modest, marks a recent increase in investment. 'We used to significantly underweight the real estate sector due to limited growth prospects, but since the government started to roll out supportive policies to the sector to boost the economy, we added positions in this sector to capture the rally,' Pan explained. 'However, we only picked high-quality SOE names with healthy fundamentals for tail risk protection.'
What is Citywire Fix The Future?
In performance terms, the JSS Equity - All China fund lost 7% in US dollar terms over the three years to the end of December 2022. This is in line with the average fund in the 179-strong Equity - China sector.
Pan is highlighted as one of the elite managers as part of Citywire's Fix The Future project, which showcases the world's top portfolio managers and showcases the companies they are investing in to make the world a better place.
When asked how his strategy aligns with long-term trends, Pan said he combines fundamental thinking with more tactical opportunities, albeit with sustainable ideas also feeding through into his portfolio.
'As China's economic growth focus shifts from quantity to quality, we believe that carbon neutrality, consumer upgrade, and healthcare are the long-term mega-trends in China,' he answered. 'Looking at the fund's top holdings and sector allocation, it is fair to say that the fund represents China's ""new economy"".
'We are significantly overweight the IT sector in which most of our holdings are renewable names, medical equipment companies with strong R&D capabilities, and consumer sectors - consumer staples and consumer discretionary - to capture the consumer upgrade megatrend.'
Pan singled out an unnamed solar wafer producer as an example of long-term investment conviction, as the managers have had exposure to the stock since the fund was launched as a Ucits vehicle in December 2019.
'We came across the name three years ago when we were doing a thorough research on the solar industry in China,' he said. 'Instead of picking the hottest name in the solar panel industry back then, we chose to invest in this company given its high growth potential with relatively cheaper valuation.
'Now the company has become the largest solar wafer producer in the world, and the profitability of wafer production has improved by more than 100%. We also actively engaged with the company's management team on ESG topics. This company's MSCI ESG rating has been increased from B to BB.'
At a stock level, Zhonghuan Renewable Energy, which manufacturers specialist semiconductor devices, is the largest individual allocation, accounting for a 9.85% position, while tech giant Tencent Holdings (9.4%) is the other notable allocation.
Looking ahead, Pan is confident that the reopening will be a driver for further growth in Chinese equities, which he believes are currently trading at a meaningful discount. 'The onshore market is trading at 0.5x STD below the three-year average P/E, and the offshore market is trading even lower at 1 STD below the three-year historical average P/E multiple, after having suffered a bigger valuation drawdown in 2021 and 2022.
'As China is now fully re-opening and consumer recovery is underway, giving opportunities for sector re-ratings, we are positive about China equity market outlook this year,' he said.

2023-02-15,a2409357,War in Ukraine: Do markets underestimate the long-term impacts?,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jacob De Tusch-Lec,"The legacy of the 12-month conflict is becoming clearer, says Artemis Global Income fund manager Jacob de Tusch-Lec.","As we approach the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, markets seem to be behaving as if the war is over.
Brent crude oil is now under $90 a barrel - it had been more than $120. In Europe gas prices are back to February 2022 levels as alternative supplies have been sourced. The FTSE is up nearly 16% since 12 October, the S&P 500 up 14% and the Euro Stoxx 50 up 26%.
But are investors being lulled into a false sense of security? The war still continues and recession warnings abound. Why so positive?
Investors always overestimate the impact of shocks and underestimate the longevity and strength of trends. A year ago, when markets plummeted and inflation began biting, it was easy to blame President Putin.
Risks exposed
The invasion disturbed seismic faults that had threatened for years. The global economy was susceptible to an energy shock because of under-investment in the energy sector. It was also vulnerable because Covid had caused havoc with supply chains. Similarly, we had not been investing sufficiently in food production and we relied too heavily on grain exports from Ukraine and Russia. There was little slack in the system. Putin exploited that weakness.
The death count rises, and we watch on with horror, especially as the conflict seems to have intensified in recent days. But the world has had to learn to accommodate the war. It sounds callous but markets have recovered from their initial shock and 'priced war in' the best they can. It is what they do.
Of course, investors may question if the full potential repercussions have been recognised. A mild winter has been a godsend for the West. Germany quickly filled its gas storage tanks, helped by LNG shipments from the US. Norway and Qatar raised gas production. Meanwhile, sanctions-stricken Russia found grey or illicit markets through which to pump its energy into global markets, easing pressure. The Covid lockdown in China has also helped, reducing demand for energy and chemicals in general.
But an enduring 'beast from the east' cold wind across Europe could change the story. So could China's re-opening. A recent EU ban on imports of Russian refined products, such as diesel and petrol, could create new shortages. And what other hidden faults are being created by the compression in food supplies globally? What trends are markets underestimating?
Legacy of the war
The West is intent on eliminating its dependency on Russia. Events of the past couple of years (or weeks, even, now we are scouting for spy balloons) have been a wake-up call on our vulnerability to China. And the issue of climate change becomes more pressing.
In the US the misleadingly titled Inflation Reduction Act - a massive investment programme - demonstrates the government's determination to build energy infrastructure and increase manufacturing capacity onshore. The US no longer wants to depend on chips from Taiwan, manufacturing from China, or energy from Brazil and Russia.
Globalisation helped reduce prices, enabling countries to specialise and companies to move production to countries with cheaper labour. Deglobalisation will reverse that pattern making the halcyon days of 2% inflation look ever more distant.
Investing today
Many investors still hope the unprofitable technology stocks that fuelled their portfolio growth during the QE days of cheap debt will rebound. Others live in fear - holding on to cash and gold, waiting for another 2008/9-scale crisis. Neither scenario may unfold.
The world may muddle through. With unemployment low, inflation may fall but remain obdurately higher than we have grown used to, and interest rates could hover around 4%.
In this scenario, unprofitable tech stocks will not carry all before them again. Sitting on the sidelines will cost savers heavily as inflation erodes capital. Dividends will become a more important part of investment returns - always the case in sideways, rangebound markets, which is a term we use when we have little idea what will happen next.
Investors must seek new areas of capital growth. Last summer I suggested they should look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs and invest in companies that provided essentials, like food, warmth and security.
We still like defence and we still hold producers of vital commodities, like Glencore (GLEN) and Exxon. But optimism around these companies is now reflected in their share prices. The biggest gains have been made. We have to move to the next turn, while following the same roadmap.
Opportunities
Markets appear more pessimistic about other areas - those most vulnerable to recession. Perhaps too pessimistic. More pain may lie ahead for retailers, airlines and banks but the yields look enticing. The best bargains are found by those courageous enough to jump when others hesitate.
More dependable returns may be found in parts of the economy that should benefit from permanently higher interest rates and shifting government spending priorities.
Bank profits tend to rise with interest rates. Buying banks in emerging markets is an especially good way to play any consumer upturn there. We hold Banco do Brasil (yielding more than 8%), the South African banking group Absa (yielding 5.8%) and Grupo Financiero Banorte - Mexico's second largest financial group (with a dividend of more than 4%), which should prosper if the US has a soft landing and moves manufacturing from China to Mexico. We hold some European banks too.
In the US we like companies set to benefit from investment in roads, bridges and the infrastructure for a low-carbon energy network. For example, we hold American multinational engineering firm Fluor Corp, which has exposure to everything from nuclear power plants to classic industrial construction.
Urgency
Dwight Eisenhower once described his urgent problems as unimportant and his important problems as not urgent. The war in Ukraine has exposed risk fault lines in the global economy. Areas that have been neglected and in need of investment for too long have suddenly become important and urgent.
In years to come the war may be seen as one of those events that changed the world's direction. It has added momentum to the deglobalisation movement and could alter the global balance of economic and political power. We are only beginning to understand the longer-term impacts and the trends that will unfold - in these lie both the biggest risks for investors and the biggest opportunities.

2023-02-15,a2409373,Hargreaves enjoys cash bonanza as rising rates lift revenues 20%,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Jack Gilbert,"Half-year results from Hargreaves Lansdown beat expectations as interest from bearish investors' cash deposits soars 967%. Nevertheless, after a good start the shares tumble.","Fund supermarket and stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown (HL) has beaten analysts' turnover expectations as revenues from clients' cash accounts ballooned by 967% in the first half of its financial year 2023.
In the six months to 31 December 2022, the DIY investor platform made revenues of PS121.6m on cash accounts, compared with PS11.3m for the same period in the previous year.
This was helped by the Bank of England hiking interest rates four times during the period, and a significant jump in clients on the platform moving into cash, which represented 11.4% of total assets under management, a rise of 9.2%.
Hargreaves holds cash accounts with a number of third-party banks that pay interest on the accounts. A portion of this interest is passed back to clients, but a significant chunk is taken by Hargreaves. It earned a margin of 160-170 basis points (bps) from cash during the period, compared with 55-60bps on its own funds.
This huge surge in margin from cash accounts helped Hargreaves make total revenues of PS350m, a rise of 20%. This was above analysts' average revenue expectations of PS325m, according to Refinitiv data.
In early trading, Hargreaves' share price leapt 6.4% to PS10.08 before reversing direction to tumble 6.8% down at 883.6p. The stock has lost nearly two thirds of its value from a May 2019 peak of PS24.19.
The broker's profit before tax also jumped by 31% to PS197.6m.
Total assets under administration fell 10%, however, reflecting steep falls in equity and bond markets, and sat at PS127.1bn at the end of 2022.
Speaking after the results, Chris Hill, Hargreaves' outgoing chief executive, said that in light of the heavy market activity, many investors had sought shelter in cash last year.
'It's important that we are working with clients to understand what it is that they need at particular times in the cycle and clearly, with low consumer confidence and low investor confidence, people have been really focused on cash,' Hill said.
'Having a diversified platform that supports that is exactly the right thing for us to do with clients right now.'
Elsewhere in the results, Hargreaves acknowledged the legal claim, brought by RGL Management in the High Court, regarding the platform's role in the collapse of the Woodford Equity Income fund.
However, Hargreaves has not yet been served with a claim form and there is no timetable set for any claim.
Hargreaves will pay an interim dividend of 12.7p per share, up 3.6%.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/hargreaves-enjoys-cash-bonanza-as-rising-rates-lift-revenues-20/a2409373,2
2023-02-16,a2409524,'We're concerned': ESG investors react to BP's net-zero backtracking,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Krystle Higgins,Investors and climate activists express concern following the oil major's announcement to scale back on its renewable transition pledges while bolstering fossil fuel production.,"Oil giant BP last week announced plans to scale back its Scope 3 emission reduction targets from 35-40% by 2030 to just 20-30%, while increasing investments in oil and gas by around EUR1bn per year.
The development is significant for the ESG funds that have invested in BP due to its (formerly) industry-leading net-zero commitments.
In Europe alone, 122 open-ended funds with a sustainable investment objective hold a combined 147.9m of BP shares according to Morningstar data, worth roughly EUR929.3m, as of 14 February 2022.
This is not BP's first retreat on climate commitments, but its latest announcement has worried shareholder activists and investors, with one non-governmental organisation (NGO) saying it is now down to shareholders to enact change, and not the oil firms themselves.
Citywire Selector reached out to the 10 Luxembourg- or Ireland-domiciled ESG funds with more than 1% of assets in the company to see how investors are responding to its net zero backtracking - and learned that several ESG investors were in the dark up until the announcement was made public in the press.
This includes the SWC (LU) EF Resp Europe Top Dividend fund, which had a 2.4% stake in BP as of the end of January. A Zurcher Kantonalbank spokesperson said the firm only became aware of the decision 'the moment it became public'.
'We are concerned by this development. BP's 20-30% CO2 reduction by 2030 does not sufficiently contribute to the overall 2C pathway of our responsible products. Therefore we closely monitor the CO2 footprint of the entire portfolio.
'As with all our responsible investment strategies, we remain committed to reducing the CO2e [carbon dioxide equivalent] intensity of our portfolio as per the Paris-aligned 2C pathway.'
Spokespeople for Vontobel
and Axa Investment Managers told Citywire Selector that investors had not been informed of BP's plans before the company earnings release.
'We will continue to monitor BP's climate change strategy closely and will engage with the company, through our partner, accordingly if needed. We will follow their next Capex announcement and net-zero strategy update with particular interest,' a Vontobel spokesperson said.
A spokesperson for Redwheel, whose Redwheel UK Climate Engagement fund has an 8.1% exposure to BP, said the firm was 'studying the changes to strategy announced by BP very carefully'.
'We have already engaged, and we will continue to engage with the company on the details and the implications for their transition plans,' the spokesperson added.
Echoing Redwheel, Zurcher Kantonalbank's spokesperson said the firm was engaging with BP through Climate Action 100+.
How does this change things?
BP is by no means an outlier in the industry.
Shell is currently facing a ground-breaking lawsuit for misleading both investors and US authorities on its own energy transition goals. This wider trend has forced some investors to analyse the sectors' ESG pledges with greater scrutiny.
Asked whether BP's announcement changes the company's ESG credentials, Axa IM's
spokesperson said the firm would 'make the necessary analysis in due course.'
'As this is breaking news we are going to take time to assess the situation. We have been engaging with BP for a few years and will continue in 2023, notably to better understand what they have announced,' said Axa IM's spokesperson.
Vontobel's spokesperson said that although the firm was 'clearly disappointed' with the changes to BP's net-zero ambitions, the oil giant's capex remains a glimmer of hope.
'The capex in the company's transition growth engine strategy is around 50%, making BP still one of the largest contributors to the energy transition worldwide.
'The company management also mentioned that the additional EUR7.4bn capex increase in oil and gas should be accompanied with lower additional operational emissions.'
Shareholder activist reaction
Others, however, were not as impressed.
In a press statement, Dutch shareholder activist NGO, Follow This, highlighted that BP's renewable spending figures were bolstered by its EUR2.8bn acquisition of renewable gas producer Archaea Energy, whereas the company's actual investments in 'low-carbon energy' fell to around EUR1bn.
Follow This founder Mark van Baal said BP's latest move highlighted the need for greater shareholder activism. 'The picture is clear now, no oil major has plans to drive down emissions this decade.
'Now it is up to the shareholders. Together with major investors, we continue to compel BP to put its full weight behind the energy transition,' he said.
This is not the first time the oil major has hit the headlines for retreating on its pledges.
Van Baal's call for action comes almost a year after BP's board urged investors to vote against a shareholder resolution filed by Follow This, which asked the British oil and gas firm to accelerate its energy transition strategy.
In a report ahead of its May 2022 annual general meeting, BP said the resolution was 'unclear, generic, disruptive and would create confusion as to board and shareholder accountabilities'.
Follow This withdrew from a collaboration with BP in 2021 - having started work with the firm in 2020 - when the NGO agreed to withdraw a resolution in order to work with its newly appointed CEO Bernard Looney.
It then formally cut ties with BP in March 2021, after the board advised shareholders against supporting a proposal Follow This put forward, for Paris-aligned targets.
Looney's 2020 energy transition strategy was heralded as one of the most ambitious within the sector, but the Irish executive has reportedly struggled to convince investors of BP's ability to run renewable energy projects profitably enough to account for the lost earnings that would have been generated through fossil fuels.
However, earlier this week BP's head of low-carbon energy insisted there was 'no link' between scaling back its renewable projects and its decision to maintain higher fossil fuel production.
Crude, not credible
Follow This also highlighted that BP has labelled carbon capture and storage a 'low carbon energy' investment, meaning that the money going to renewables is lower than the EUR3.7bn suggested in the earnings report. The NGO also criticised BP for calling its EUR0.5bn acquisition of power trader EDF Energy Services a 'low carbon energy' investment.
'We welcome this increase in renewables, but investments in oil (EUR5bn) and gas (EUR3bn) still eclipse investments in renewables,' wrote Van Baal.
'If the bulk of your investments remain tied to fossil fuels, and you even plan to increase those investments, you cannot maintain to be Paris-aligned, because you will not achieve large-scale emissions reductions by 2030, he added.
Nicola Koch, head of retail investing at the 2 Degree Investing Institute (2DII), told Citywire Selector that the oil major's failure to meet previous climate targets should be reflected in its ESG ratings - but this might not necessarily happen.
'Given that ESG rating methodologies vary between ESG rating agencies and that an ESG score is an aggregate of E, S and G, it might be possible that the total score would not change if, let's say, improvements in the S and G scores would compensate the [downgrade] in the emission category,' Koch said.
This was echoed by Sasja Beslik, chief investment strategy officer at SDG Impact Japan. 'Any diversion from set targets should be seriously reflected in the assessments of any company, not only BP. Many companies and many investors are trying to ""package"" this as ""in the end it will be fine"". It will not,' said Beslik.
Power in stewardship
To Koch, BP's announcement shows there needs to be more scrutiny about the integrity and transparency of companies' emission reduction targets.
He pointed to 2DII's Pacta methodology as a tool that can help investors assess whether companies are changing their production plans and capex according to their publicly communicated climate targets.
'Even emission targets of self-labelled ""climate leaders"" are too often insufficient in terms of their integrity and transparency. This even includes companies with targets verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative - while SBTi is generally a good initiative there are still some aspects to fix,' said Koch.
He emphasised, however, that climate stewardship remains the most effective strategy to change the behaviour of large publicly-listed companies.
'Since we cannot wait for effective and internationally coherent carbon taxes, investors who really care about the climate should use their stewardship power to urge BP to stick with their previous targets via direct engagement or shareholder resolutions on BP's AGM,' said Koch.
'It will be very interesting to see how large investors who are perceived as ""climate stewardship front runners"" according to Influence Map's Climate Stewardship Ranking, such as BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole or UBS, will react there,' he added.
A Coutts spokesperson did not respond to Citywire Selector's questions but instead highlighted that the Coutts UK ESG Insights Equity fund is an index fund managed by its multi-asset team and 'does not have discretion to exclude certain stocks'.
While the fund has limits on its exposure to controversial activities such as thermal coal, arctic oil and gas, and oil sands, fossil fuel companies remain investable.

2023-02-16,a2409673,Why Martin Currie's Osmani scrapped Tencent and TSMC,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Caroline Hug,The portfolio manager switched out TSMC for Dutch rival ASML and ditched his hefty allocation to Tencent after his Global Unconstrained fund lost 8.1% in the past year.,"Martin Currie fund manager Zehrid Osmani has scrapped his allocations to Asian tech giants Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and Tencent, admitting he miscalculated the risk/reward ratio these firms faced in the domestic market.
As a quality-growth investor, the portfolio manager was less than pleased with the performance of his PS45m Global Unconstrained
strategy last year.
The fund lost 8.1% over 12 months to the end of January, while the sector average return was a 4% gain. Over three years, its performance is even further behind: the strategy is down 6%, compared with a 24.4% sector average.
That led to investor redemptions of close to PS68m over the same period, according to Morningstar data.
The rising bond yield environment in 2022 spurred a shift away from long-duration and quality-growth assets towards value. As Osmani's funds do not invest in value stocks, they performed poorly.
He attributed his strategy's underperformance over the past year to three main factors: the lack of energy companies, his allocation to medical technology, and his direct exposure to China.
'We should have sold Tencent'
During the past year, Osmani's portfolio was substantially exposed to Greater China, as he held stocks including Tencent, JD.com, and TSMC.
'We had issues quantifying the risk those companies were facing in the domestic market versus the reward,' he said.
Although he sold out of Alibaba in 2021 on the basis that the China regulatory threat would diminish its returns, he felt Tencent was less at risk.
'In hindsight, we should have exited both at that time. It took us longer to make the same conclusion on Tencent.'
Osmani sold out of his 2.4% allocation to Tencent in October, mainly because of the lack of visibility on the regulatory front and the increasing political risk in China.
The sale came before Tencent's recovery in the aftermath of the Chinese government's zero-Covid U-turn, but Osmani said he was unlikely to buy into the stock despite depressed valuations.
'There is evidence that the company is pushing to fund common-prosperity measures. The request for funding has been quite sizeable, at $50bn [PS41.5bn], which could equate to an investment with 0% return.'
Osmani, who also runs the bigger Martin Currie Global Portfolio (MNP ) investment trust now prefers to have long-term exposure to the Chinese middle-class emerging consumer through companies indirectly exposed to the country.
One example is L'Oreal: his portfolio has a 4.5% allocation to the stock, which he believes has a growing consumer base in emerging markets.
The company navigated the pandemic well because it predominantly serves customers online. Osmani drew attention to China, where 50% of products are sold online.
'At L'Oreal, the return ratio is very low, and the value of products is very high in small amounts. The company has a very attractive algorithm of quality growth.'
According to Osmani, the company's growing topline revenues are close to 10%, and over the next five years, they will have an earnings rate of 9% annualised, and cashflows of 7% annualised.
Trading out TSMC for ASML
The manager also traded out his hefty 6.2% allocation to TSMC in April last year in exchange for Dutch rival ASML, which is now the fund's top holding.
He said the stock was strongly positioned to benefit from the trend of companies onshoring semiconductor production.
'While TSMC had held off quite well to the tech selloff, ASML had pulled back significantly. That gave us the opportunity to have a stock that had more upside to price target than TSMC, while giving us the same ecosystem exposure.'
His sale of TSMC came months before Warren Buffett's sale of the chip-maker this week, which caused its shares to slide.
Osmani said ASML had a similar bottom-line growth to TSMC but a better profile in terms of return on invested capital (ROIC).
ASML forecasts revenue growth of 14% annualised, but TSMC forecasts 17% annualised. Both forecast an earnings growth of 12%.
Despite this, ASML had 32% ROIC last year, trending towards 34% in five years, while TSMC had 35% ROIC last year, trending towards 31% in five years.
'We moved further upstream in the ecosystem, as ASML sells its products to all semiconductor producers,' he said.
He said ASML was well positioned to benefit from political risks concerning Taiwan and China, as regions seek to make production more localised.
'The US has already been pushing ASML to build plants closer to home. Europe will also be doing the same thing soon. This will lead to higher topline growth, more scale benefits and higher profitability.'
Outlook for 2023
Osmani's outlook for the year hinges on monetary policy, which will dictate market direction. If monetary policy reaches a plateau, the fund manager believes this will be good for risky assets, ultimately benefiting his fund's quality-growth investment style.
If central banks continue to hike interest rates, then the inverse would be true, as value would lead the style rotation.
'For quality growth to perform, we don't need to have central banks move to a cutting cycle. We just need an expectation of stable rates.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/why-martin-currie-s-osmani-scrapped-tencent-and-tsmc/a2409673,3

In its annual report, the bank also committed to restricting finance to companies that generate more than 10% of their revenue from oil sands activities, and will also not finance new oil sands pipelines.
Barclays is the biggest European financier for oil sands between 2016 and 2021, according to Banking On Climate Chaos, and the announcement comes a week after 27 investors representing $1.4tn (EUR1.3tn) in assets asked Barclays to stop financing oil and gas fields.
Jeanne Martin, head of ShareAction's banking programme, called Barclay's decision 'an encouraging step forward', but emphasised it was not sufficient to satisfy investors.
'Disappointingly, despite not having published a new oil and gas policy for the last three years, the bank's fracking policy remains unchanged and there is no mention of new oil and gas,' said Martin.
'This means Barclays continues to be out of step with current minimum standards of ambition within the industry.'
ShareAction has identified the bank as the second biggest European lender for the 50 largest oil and gas expanders between 2016 and 2021.
'Barclays should step up and act swiftly to update its oil and gas policy ahead of its 2023 AGM to meet science-based standards on climate that have made it clear there is no room for new oil and gas fields if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C,' Martin added.
'Otherwise, the bank should be prepared to deal with further shareholder action to encourage Barclays to meaningfully align with its net zero goal.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/barclays-ends-oil-sands-financing-following-shareholder-pressure/a2409496,1

More recently it was described as the most 'crowded trade' in global markets.
The Communist Party Congress held last October revealed little about President Xi Jinping's mindset and unnerved many with its overt demonstrations of authoritarian power.
However, within weeks, the country's controversial 'zero-Covid' policy was lifted and much more business-friendly noises were coming out of Beijing.
Citywire Selector spoke to Morningstar's chief investment officer Dan Kemp, Asia specialist Jane Andrews of boutique group BambuBlack and North of South Capital fund manager Kamil Dimmich about how they operate in such a volatile market.
What does uninvestible mean?
Kemp (pictured above), whose company is responsible for more than $230bn in assets under management, said, despite last year's turbulence, China has remained one of Morningstar's 'highest convictions'.
'We looked at the difference in valuation between great technology stocks in the US and great technology stocks in China and there was a massive differential. It was because the Chinese government seemed to be reining in the growth of these tech stocks and there were concerns about the US listings.
'Everyone knew the problems of investing in these Chinese companies in a way that they didn't seem to know about when the prices were 50% higher a year or two before.'
Kemp said periods of negative sentiment like this can be a great time to buy. 'At a point where everyone can see the downside and no one can see the upside is normally when the best opportunities come along. The ultimate expression of that is normally when someone says something is uninvestible. But what does that really mean?
'It's either to say that something is so volatile that clients can't remain invested, which can be dealt with by sizing your position, or as you look at the possible outcomes for stocks, one part of the model is a zero. Again, that can be dealt with through sizing. Providing you don't overcommit to these stocks and understand what you're buying, then they're not uninvestable.'
Kemp said Chinese stocks, in particular those in the tech sector, remained in Morningstar portfolios for most of the year.
'For most of that period, they looked a pretty awful thing to own but, more recently, they've looked much better and they're still nowhere near the value they were before the government cracked down.'
In hindsight, it was buying time
Around the time of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, BambuBlack founder Jane Andrews (pictured above) told Citywire Selector how she had switched to a larger position in India than China due to the perceived headwinds at the time.
Looking back, she said, like many others, she had been wrongfooted.  'At the Party Congress, everybody was thinking Xi had consolidated power in a way that nobody imagined that he could.
'That was the exact time, with hindsight, to be starting to buy China, just as everybody was giving up on it. Just as you had all those negative headlines and US funds taking China out of their remit. It was not a great time for us during November.'
Andrews, who runs two Asian equity funds at her boutique, said she has since tilted her position back towards China and favours its tech stocks.
'The market really started moving, but we waited to get a little bit more detail. Then we got that significant U-turn on Covid. But it wasn't just that. We began to get signs that they wanted stability, wanted to support consumption and suddenly were being more supportive of the big tech companies.
'That, for me, was a significant shift - the change towards the private sector and equity markets. After two years of having regulatory headwinds, we've started to see the signs of thawing.'
Andrews said she added to China in December and continued building positions in 2023.
'We're now neutral or slightly overweight China. We put back in some of the big internet companies.'
Another positive signal she identified was a shift towards better corporate governance among some of these companies.
'For us, this was also a sea change. There have been improvements in corporate governance.
'There's still a way to go, but they are definitely making steps in the right direction. We've put these tech stocks back into the portfolios, and we've increased exposure to some of the opening-up names.'
Elsewhere in the emerging market complex, Andrews remained bullish in her conviction that India had a bright future, which is often compared to China.
'I still like India medium to long term. It has got a really positive structural story with its demographics and the young population. There's the industrialisation they need to do but Modi and the government there have been very keen to promote it.
'The demographics look much more attractive than China. Valuations are stretched in India, so we're seeing some consolidation there. In the short term, we've reduced our India weighting to increase our Chinese weighting. However, we're still marginally overweight India.'
Ignore the political noise
Kamil Dimmich, who co-runs the Pacific North of South Emerging Markets All Cap Equity
fund, agreed with Dan Kemp's view that China's unpopularity last year had made it an opportunity for those with a steady nerve.
'We're value investors and we try not to get too distracted by political noise, while we have to be cognizant of what's going on,' said Dimmich (pictured above).
'There were very good reasons why China had become quite unpopular in recent years. Going into last year we had been very underweight China. The game plan was to keep buying China as people kept hating it and trying to get out.
'For value investors, that's really an opportunity. The medium-term view was that China would abandon the zero-Covid policy, which was becoming increasingly untenable.'
Depite his confidence, Dimmich was also surprised by the speed of change in Chinese policy direction. 'Around the Congress, the political noise was quite intense. You had some very headline-grabbing scenes, such as the former chairman being led out of the congress.
'We read through the texts that were being put out and they were focused on China fighting and being aggressive, while not very focused on developing the economy or promoting business. There was very little indication that there was an exit strategy from zero-Covid on the way and people forget that now.'
Dimmich made a slightly ominous comparison with Russia in terms of how an authoritarian state can be difficult to read. 'China is like Russia was previously - and Russia is no longer investable.
'You have to be cognizant that you can analyse all kinds of political undercurrents but in the end, what happens in Putin's head happens in Putin's head. You don't know what his decision is until he decides to show it to you. This is exactly what happened with Ukraine.
'It's the same with China, you didn't really know what Xi is going to decide. It didn't look like he was planning to exit zero-Covid and then he suddenly did. What then followed was an avalanche of good, or less bad, news in terms of policy direction.'
Dimmich believes, even though China is 'reopening', it is a different prospect today compared with its two decades of hyper-growth following the turn of the century.
'It's important to keep in mind that there are structural trends that may have been accelerated by Covid but weren't necessarily created by it. Previously the world was gradually shifting all of its manufacturing to China. That trend had already stopped by Covid and it's now going into reverse.'
He said this would continue to be driven by energy, demographic and security trends.
'The root cause of going to China for manufacturing was cheap labour and energy. Energy was produced very cheaply using coal fired power but that was changing because China was trying to reduce CO2 emissions.
'With labour, China demographically has run out of spare labour and the population has started declining. Even Chinese companies that we've known for many years have already been shifting production to Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia in areas like textiles or shoe making.
'Another issue is national security and strategic supply, which is being driven by the US.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/managing-the-mood-swings-how-these-investors-handle-the-chinese-market/a2409420,5

The UK's blue-chip index rallied 0.6%, or 45 points, to 8,043 in early trading, securing its place above the 8,000 mark after tentatively breaking the milestone level yesterday as it was propelled by optimism that inflation has peaked.
Steve Clayton, manager of the HL Select UK Growth and HL Select UK Income
funds, said the small fall in inflation to 10.1% in January is being taken as an 'invitation to the Bank of England to ease off and stop raising interest rates sooner than previously expected'.
'Whether that happens depends on what data follows,' he said. 'Inflation is still in double digits and unemployment is low. Given the Bank has a 2% inflation target, pausing any time soon could look like being asleep at the wheel.'
British Gas owner Centrica was the main driver of returns, jumping 5%, or 4p, to 103p after reporting a trebling in annual profits, joining energy peers who have all enjoyed a boost from the jump in energy prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, workers' union Unite has described the profits as 'obscene'.
Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: 'These energy companies are showing us everything that is wrong with the UK's broken economy.'
Clayton said that while Centrica made millions, British Gas actually saw profits slide 39% to PS72m 'in no small part due to the company spending PS75m on customer assistance measures'.
Global information and analytics group Relx (RELX) rose 3.6%, or 88p, to PS25.36 after announcing an PS800m share buyback and that it expects to deliver another year of strong growth after revenues jumped 9% in 2022 and profit grew 15% to PS2.7bn.
A share buyback from Standard Chartered (STAN) was also a boon for the Asian-focused bank, which has faced speculation of a bid by First Abu Dhabi bank and reported weaker-than-expected profits in the fourth quarter. Its shares gained 2.8% to 750p.
The FTSE 250 firmed 0.2%, or 42 points, to 20,215, led by Bank of Georgia (BGEO), up 5.8%, or 160p, at PS28.80 after announcing an extension of its share buybacks in its full-year results.
Mid-cap gains were capped by tumbling Indivior (INDV) shares, which shed 10.7%, or 209p, to PS17.45 after the maker of opioid addiction medicines set aside $290m (PS241m) for litigation in the US.
Moneysupermarket (MONY) slid 8.1%, or 19p, at 216p, despite returning to revenue and profit growth in 2022. Revenues climbed 22% to PS387m and profits soared 37% to PS103m.
In investment trust news, Scottish American (SAIN ) was up 2.3% at 522p, Fidelity Emerging Markets (FEM ) was up 2% at 644p, and VinaCapital Vietnam Opportunities (VOF ) enjoyed a second day of gains, adding 1.9% to trade at 466p.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/ftse-opens-above-8000-as-centrica-profits-surge/a2409476,13
2023-02-16,a2409413,Fidelity splits Emea fund with only Russian assets remaining,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Caroline Hug,Fidelity plans to split all but Russian assets from its Emea strategy and create a new Sustainable Emerging Markets Equity fund.,"Fidelity is splitting the assets of its Emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa (Emea) fund, Citywire Selector's sister site Citywire Wealth Manager has learned.
Following a shareholder vote on 8 February, the assets of the Emea fund will be split, resulting in only Russian holdings remaining in the fund.
Investors in the Emea strategy will continue to hold shares in the fund, while also receiving an equal number of shares in the newly created Fidelity Sustainable Emerging Markets Equity (SEME) fund.
The step follows similar moves by Schroders and JPM Asset Management to split their Emerging Europe funds to silo the Russian exposure.
In March 2022, Fidelity soft-closed its Emea fund to new investments due to liquidity issues following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The strategy, managed by Nick Price, Zoltan Palfi and Chris Tennant, had an 8.6% exposure to Russia, with Russian energy giant Gazprom among its top 10 holdings.
Before the closure, the firm had hoped to rebrand the strategy to the Fidelity Sustainable Emerging Markets fund and include it in its range of sustainable funds, which invest at least 70% of assets in companies with strong sustainability characteristics.
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, however, the fund's performance was hit badly, with performance down 37.3% over the three months to the end of that month.
Price lost his Citywire AA rating and Konstantinidis lost his A rating the following month.
Price said subsequently that he had 'underestimated the likelihood and the impact of the invasion'.
The asset split is due to take place on 24 March, with shares in the new SEME fund available three days later, from 27 March.
Following the split, investors will no longer be able to buy or sell shares in the Emea fund, which will be closed. Russian assets will be sold with the aim of returning value to shareholders.
A spokesperson for Fidelity said: 'Existing Russian holdings will remain in the Emea fund, effectively making it an ""external side pocket"".
'Non-Russian holdings will either be transferred to the new SEME fund or sold down to cash, with the balance transferred to the new fund. The SEME fund will then initiate exposure to additional selected emerging markets companies that we believe maintain strong sustainability characteristics.
'Going forward, the new Fidelity Sustainable Emerging Markets Equity fund will have a new and differentiated investment policy to the Emea fund, with a more concentrated portfolio of 30 to 50 holdings.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/fidelity-splits-emea-fund-with-only-russian-assets-remaining/a2409413,2

In addition, both funds at Article 8 compliant under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, while also investing in broadly similar investment universes.
In performance terms, the Nordea 1 - Nordic Ideas Equity fund returned 33.4% in euro terms over the three years to the end of December 2022, while the Nordea 1 - Nordic Equity fund returned 33.1% over the same timeframe.

'Sam's expertise and thoughtful guidance have been integral to the development of products and strategies that continue to differentiate our platform as a leading manager of active fixed income assets and provider of customized solutions,' the memo continued.
Finkelstein manages about $4bn across several Goldman Sachs Asset Management mutual funds, some of which he has been in charge of for more than 20 years, according to Morningstar data.
He will step off these funds when he leaves the firm in June.
Morningstar analyst Thomas Murphy said he would monitor the effect of Finkelstein's departure on funds, which includes the $653m Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Debt
fund, from which another manager, Ricardo Penfold, left in late January.
Murphy noted that Nicholas Saunders, the head of emerging market corporate credit, would be added to the fund effective 1 May and that Haigh had been the lead PM for nearly three years. He also acknowledged that the pending integration of the emerging markets debt team from NN Investment Partners, which Goldman acquired last year, could affect the team.

2023-02-16,a2409435,European Parliament approves Eltif changes paving way for private markets boom,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Selin Bucak,The amendments are set to come into force in the first quarter of 2024.,"The European Parliament has voted to approve changes to the bloc's long-term fund regime, paving the way for increasing retail access to private assets.
The vote, held on 15 February, follows the European Commission's proposal to amend the European Long-Term Investment Funds (Eltif) regulation at the end of 2021.
Although Eltifs were launched in 2015, pickup has been slow with only 30 funds launched in the first five years raising less than EUR2bn.
A recent Citywire study found there has since been a rise in registrations, with a total of 80 vehicles set up and at least EUR10bn in capital raised.
The increase in activity has been partially driven by anticipated changes to the regime and a rise in interest from individual investors in private markets.
The changes approved by the Parliament will help broaden the investment universe for Eltifs, making it more attractive for investors, while getting rid of or lowering some of the entry thresholds, such as the minimum investment requirement of EUR10,000 for retail investors.
The revamped regime has the potential to become an attractive go-to fund structure for long-term investments, according to the European Fund and Asset Management Association (Efama).
'The changes to the current Eltif framework are an excellent and necessary step forward that will assist Eltif in becoming a complementary source of financing for the European real economy and notably, accessing the almost untapped retail market for longer-term real assets investments,' said Antoine de la Gueronniere, vice-chair of the Efama fund regulation standing committee.
The revised regulation is expected to be published in March and come into force in the first quarter of 2024. Existing Eltifs will remain compliant for five years after that. If they want to take advantage of the new regime, they will be able to, as long as they notify their national competent authority.",https://citywireselector.com/news/european-parliament-approves-eltif-changes-paving-way-for-private-markets-boom/a2409435,2
2023-02-17,a2409629,Amundi launches second vintage of real estate private debt fund,Launch of new products,Threat,CityWire,Ian Heath,Article 8 fund will focus on quality property investments and is targeting final size of EUR600m.,"Amundi has launched the second vintage of its real estate private debt fund.
The Amundi Commercial Real Estate Loans II (ACREL II), which is classified as Article 8 under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, will target a net internal rate of return of at least 5% and has already raised EUR150m, with a target final size of around EUR600m.
This marks the second vintage of the senior mortgage fund ACREL I, which raised EUR443m from European institutional investors.
The fund will invest in the major eurozone economies, with a focus on sectors such as premium office space, logistics and managed residential properties. It will target property-backed debt with 'core or core+' [higher] quality risk profiles, with a stock-picking model focused on safety, diversification, ESG criteria and relative value.
It will aim to help finance the energy transition by monitoring energy performance and carbon footprint, as well as the environmental certification credentials of assets. It will also use a proprietary methodology to assess ESG criteria, in particular green financing.
Bertrand Carrez, head of credit real estate debt at Amundi, said: 'With this successor fund ACREL II, we aim to offer investors indirect exposure to real estate that will be both resilient and offer a high relative value, building on the success of the first vintage which demonstrated the depth of our market access, as well as the robustness and agility of our management model.'
Amundi is Europe's largest asset manager with EUR1.9tn in assets under management.
Its real estate private debt platform, which launched in 2018, is responsible for more than EUR2.2bn of commitments and has invested in around 50 deals.",https://citywireselector.com/news/amundi-launches-second-vintage-of-real-estate-private-debt-fund/a2409629,0
2023-02-17,a2409653,What is ESG and is it woke? We asked a robot,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Will Schmitt,... and other adventures at the horizon where the great sea of fund management meets the vast open air of artificial intelligence.,"Lately, many people have been buzzing about the weird wonder of artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT.
It has drawn oohs and aahs from the public for its broad knowledge base (despite the occasional 'plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers') and feats such as passing a law exam (albeit with 'mediocre' performance).
ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, has won a multi-billion dollar investment from Microsoft and triggered innumerable questions, imitators, and think pieces about when, not whether, such technology will render white-collar workers obsolete.
Our writers and readers have no small amount of self-interest in proving that their jobs cannot be done by a robot, but there might be some areas in which this new wonder machine can help, for example defining those awkward financial terms that have eluded consensus. The most obvious of these is ESG, a set of letters that have become deeply divisive in both the investment industry and politics.
So, how does our new chatbot overlord/future colleague define ESG?
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, and it refers to a set of criteria used in the investment process to evaluate the performance of companies in terms of their impact on the environment, society, and governance practices. ESG factors are considered to be non-financial indicators of a company's long-term performance and can be used to identify companies that may be more sustainable, responsible, and better equipped to navigate a rapidly changing global economy. ESG investing is becoming increasingly popular among investors as it aims to generate long-term financial returns while also promoting positive social and environmental outcomes.
Fine. Naturally, there are things in there that critics or proponents of ESG might take issue with but it's not a bad answer. So we decided to step up the difficulty level and ask 'Do you think ESG is ""woke""?'
As is common for ChatGPT's answers, it starts by defining its terms. 'Woke,' for the AI chatbot, is boiled down to 'the awareness of social and political issues, particularly those related to race and social justice'.
Interestingly, ChatGPT's machine brain puts at least a partial partition between being woke and investing according to ESG principles, though it acknowledges that 'there may be some overlap between the two concepts'.
The use of the term 'woke' is often associated with a specific political or social perspective, and it's important to note that the adoption of ESG factors in investing is not inherently political or partisan. It's a way for investors to consider the long-term performance and sustainability of companies they are investing in.
'Long-term performance' was also the top answer for ChatGPT when we asked it for pros of ESG investing.
1. Long-term performance: Companies that prioritise ESG factors may have a competitive advantage in the long term, as they are better equipped to manage risks and capitalise on opportunities related to environmental and social issues. 2. Risk management: ESG considerations can help identify potential risks that may not be captured by traditional financial analysis, such as reputational risks or regulatory changes. 3. Alignment with personal values: ESG investing allows investors to align their investments with their personal values, such as a desire to promote environmental sustainability or support socially responsible companies.4. Better alignment with sustainable development goals: ESG factors align with the sustainable development goals and promote sustainable development.
And the cons:
1. Potential for lower returns: Some critics argue that focusing on ESG factors may lead to lower returns, as it may limit the pool of investment opportunities. 2. Lack of standardisation: There is currently a lack of standardisation in the way ESG factors are defined and measured, which can make it difficult for investors to compare the performance of different companies. 3. Difficulties in measuring the impact: It can be challenging to measure the impact of a company's ESG practices and there can be a lack of transparency on the information provided by companies. 4. Limited data availability: There may be limited data available on certain ESG factors, particularly for smaller or emerging companies, which can make it difficult for investors to make informed decisions.
Given how divisive it has become, we asked ChatGPT what was so controversial about ESG? In short, it's the last two letters.
The Environmental aspect of ESG investing is generally considered to be the least controversial aspect. Environmental considerations in ESG investing typically focus on a company's impact on the environment, such as its greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and waste management practices. This aspect of ESG investing is widely recognised as important for mitigating the negative impacts of climate change and promoting sustainability. The Social and Governance aspects of ESG investing are sometimes considered more controversial, as they may involve making value judgments about a company's practices and policies in areas such as labour rights, human rights, and political activism. These aspects of ESG investing can be more subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives and values. However, it's important to note that all three aspects of ESG investing - Environmental, Social, and Governance - are important for a comprehensive and thorough evaluation of a company's performance and sustainability. The interdependence of these factors means that a company's environmental impact, for example, can be affected by its social and governance practices, and vice versa.
Maybe there's some middle ground that critics and supporters alike can agree on when it comes to ESG investing -- right, ChatGPT?
Well, when we asked it to name something that critics and supporters could agree on about ESG, ChatGPT flashed a black square at us for several minutes before leaving us with the following:
'An error occurred.'
After two attempts, the machine came up with something:
ESG considerations are of 'growing importance' and there is a 'need for transparency and accountability in the ESG investing process,' including better data and metrics.
But also:
Both critics and supporters of ESG investing can also agree that ESG considerations can provide valuable insights into the long-term performance and sustainability of companies (and) ESG investing can help identify companies that are better positioned to succeed in the long term and to navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing global economy.
This prompted one human reporter to frown and ask aloud, 'Really?' before proceeding to the next and final question: 'Does ChatGPT have a pro-ESG bias?'
ChatGPT's response was somewhere between the robot () and Moai () emojis as it insisted it did not 'have personal opinions, emotions, or biases'.
'Regarding ESG investing, my role is to provide objective and informative answers based on the data and information available on the topic,' ChatGPT huffed. 'I do not promote or advocate for any particular investment strategy or approach, and it is up to individuals to make informed decisions about their investments based on their own goals and circumstances.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/what-is-esg-and-is-it-woke-we-asked-a-robot/a2409653,6

2023-02-17,a2409675,"Advisers turn to emerging markets, hopeful of US rates peak",Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Nicola Blackburn,"After a difficult few years, financial advisers are betting on emerging markets as US inflation and interest rates subside.","Financial advisers are betting on emerging market equities to deliver strong returns in the hope that US inflation and interest rates have peaked.
Recent years have proven difficult for investors in the sector, with funds in Citywire's Equity - Global Emerging Markets sector returning an average of 9.9% over the past three years and having fallen 5% over one year.
But with US interest rates likely approaching their peak and the US dollar undergoing a steep decline in recent months, advisers have reasons to be hopeful.
Almost half of them expect emerging markets to be the best-performing equity sector in 2023, according to a survey of delegates at Citywire's New Model Adviser annual conference last week. There is significantly more optimism about global emerging markets than there is about developed market equities (see chart below).
Beckett Investment Management Group in Bury St Edmunds has been overweight emerging markets for some time.
'We are long-term investors and were relying on, at some stage, inflation coming under control,' said Beckett's portfolio manager Tony Yousefian, referring to the negative impact of US inflation on emerging markets.
'Our bullishness built up from the start of the fourth quarter last year and we became more bullish as inflation began to fall in the US,' he explained.
Beckett allocates 18.5% of its in-house global equity fund to Asian and emerging market equity funds. Among its underlying investments are the PS2.6bn Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity fund, the PS331.8m Aikya Global Emerging Markets fund, and the PS97m Redwheel Next Generation Emerging Markets Equity fund.
Of these, the Redwheel strategy was the only one to post significant returns over 2022, although Aikya's offering did also outperform the MSCI EM benchmark (see chart below).
*source, Morningstar
However, Yousefian expects the emerging market overweight position to soon pay off.
'If one subscribes to the idea that interest rates in the US are closer to their peak, then the dollar should start to weaken and that appears to have already started,' he said.
Opportunity
Advisers said a range of factors, from a bleak outlook for the US economy to China's reopening, would influence positive emerging market equity performance.
Jessica McGuigan, an Oxford-based wealth planner at the Kingswood Group, said money pulled from US equities in 2023 would likely be reallocated to emerging markets.
'People will move away from the US and reduce exposure, so it is likely that emerging markets will move into its place,' she said. 'Obviously, if demand is high, that will push prices up in emerging markets.'
Oliver Suter, financial planner at Investment Solutions Wealth Management in Worthing, West Sussex, agrees that investors reallocating capital from developed market equities will likely boost returns for the sector.
'A lot of emerging markets exposure is made up of China,' he said. 'With China having done most of the tough work in terms of their lockdowns, we'd like to think they're through the worst of what they're dealing with. So hopefully we will see some ticking up [in emerging market funds].'
After a year of negative performance, data suggests investors are starting to turn bullish on China. Funds in the IA's China/Greater China sector returned about 8.4% in January but lost 4.7% in the year to February.
Balancing risk
Advisers agree that more exposure to emerging markets requires paring back risk elsewhere. For Suter, it would require reducing positions in UK or US equities to ensure portfolios still meet volatility targets.
Such a balancing act is required because emerging market funds have demonstrated more volatility than most other global equity sectors. Over three years, funds in Citywire's Equity - Global Emerging Markets sector reported a higher average standard deviation than most of the 15 biggest Morningstar fund categories in the UK (see table below).
Standard deviation measures risk by calculating how a fund's performance deviates from the sector mean.

Due to this higher embedded risk, Beckett's Yousefian believes an overweight position to emerging market funds requires going underweight in other, riskier equity sectors.
'We have risk buckets we work to, and that is then divided between different asset classes,' he said.
'In our overseas funds, we reduced our mid- and small-cap exposure in developed markets, and that enabled us to add risk by adding to emerging markets. That's how we've been able to achieve the overweight position.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/advisers-turn-to-emerging-markets-hopeful-of-us-rates-peak/a2409675,5

'We're all focusing on GDP but eventually, corporate results will really give a sense of how the real economy is doing. Here, we think there is risk because investors are not pricing in earnings per share recession while we believe we're already in a recession,' Monica Defend told Citywire Selector.
Defend called the focus on GDP and lack of attention on earnings 'asymmetric' as some sectors - notably tech - are already showing recession signs.
'We're in the middle of reporting season and corporate CIOs are reviewing on the downside, and the top line is going down - this is why we believe recession will continue on the earnings side.
'Earnings recession might not drive into an economic recession but it is equally painful for financial markets,' she said.
'When it materialises we're in an earnings recession, then [markets will] correct on the downside, and we're preparing for it in the way we are positioning,' she added.
Amundi is currently underweight equities and is particularly cautious in Europe and the US, preferring instead emerging markets and particularly China. 'It's a matter of valuation', Defend said.
The firm has also been reducing its exposure to the US dollar from its overweight last year as geopolitical risks and concerns around a Chinese recession have faded. 'It was a safe haven last year, but now [the safe haven] is the Japanese yen or Swiss franc,' she said.
She also highlighted gold as a hedge against inflation and expects it to rise further as investors become less concerned about inflation and more about growth.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/investors-aren-t-pricing-in-earnings-recession-warns-amundi-institute/a2409498,0

That's the view of Jacques-Aurelien Marcireau, who manages the Tech Impact
and Big Data
funds at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management.
He is the top performer in Citywire's Equity - Robotics and AI sector over the last three years with a total return of 36.9%. This is against a 20.2% sector average from the 22-strong category.
Speaking to Citywire Selector, Marcireau said he expected tech innovation to continue to thrive but did not foresee a return to the sky-high valuations of the Covid-19 crisis.
'The three factors that we had two years ago, which was the Covid benefit, zero cost of capital and the booming environment, will not repeat,' he said. 'We believe that valuation multiples are still not back to normalised level, at least for publicly listed equities.
'We're not so sure about tech outperformance overall this year, even though we believe that there are pockets of very interesting areas in tech that we'll strive to exploit.'
Creation in the tempest
Marcireau said a tighter monetary climate would create a more competitive environment for tech innovators, describing it with the French phrase 'creation in the tempest'.
'There's a clear window of opportunity to create the next wave of tech. It will be about being the best navigator or steward of the environment.
'What will be very interesting in the coming quarters and years is a lot of interesting technology and companies will be for sale. You will have a lot of unicorns that will not survive in a world without money but they might have very interesting technologies.'
He was adamant that the days of mega-cap tech companies buying out promising startups were over because of stricter anti-trust rules, as recently evidenced by Microsoft's struggle to buy gaming giant Activision Blizzard.
'I believe that Big Tech will not be able to do what they used to do because of the regulators. Google bought YouTube at an interesting time. Facebook bought Instagram and then WhatsApp. This kind of thing cannot happen again.
'You can feel the level of scrutiny around any deal made by Google, Facebook, Amazon or Microsoft is super-high now. It will be tough for them to do deals, except if it's very far away from their base. And in that case, the chance of success for them is lower.'
Instead, Marcireau backed second-tier tech companies as purchasers. 'I believe there will be acquisitions and a lot of M&As taking place but more with tier two players, like ServiceNow and Palo Alto Networks.
'They want to do acquisitions and now have a better chance of doing that. I believe the opportunity is more on their side with consolidation and good technologies to be bought on the cheap.'
An area of tech innovation which could thrive over the next decade is vertical software, he said, as this targets niche markets, such as restaurant point-of-sale system Toast.
Marcireau said improved access to high levels of data on cloud and internet systems would improve this type of software dramatically.
He also said the confluence of healthcare and tech was an area to watch because of data trends such as genomic sequencing. He named radiology tech firm RadNet as a stock in this space within his portfolio.",https://citywireselector.com/news/why-more-tech-unicorns-will-be-up-for-sale-but-big-tech-won-t-be-buying/a2409501,3

Scriven founded Dragon Capital, the oldest independent asset manager in the country, after moving to Vietnam in the early 1990s, having worked for firms including M&G in Hong Kong.
In a 39-minute interview, he discusses the lessons learnt since launching VEIL in 1995 and the challenges of portfolio management in what is still considered a frontier market.
'The direction has never been in doubt - the timing most certainty has been,' Scriven says.
Vietnam's economy was one of the fastest growing in the world in 2022, delivering 8% growth. But its stock market was down 32% in local currency terms (26% in sterling) with both the retail traders (who dominate the market) and international investors exiting during an anti-corruption drive that saw the head of the Ho Chi Minh stock exchange dismissed.
After a rebound since the start of this year, shares in VEIL are now down 23% over one year but up 25% over five. That has seen the trust fall behind the gains for rivals VinaCapital Vietnam Opportunity (VOF ), 51.5%, and VietNam Holding (VNH ), 38%, over the same period.
Scriven talks about the key issues at play and highlights one recent scandal that may affect Eximbank, which Dragon invests in.
But while markets may have run ahead of the local capacity to regulate for a time, Scriven says Vietnam's long-term growth remains very much intact and argues that rising prosperity will continue to boost the market's key banking and real estate sectors.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/vietnam-s-oldest-trust-on-its-most-turbulent-year-yet/a2409431,5

2023-02-17,a2409477,The unerring quest for 'quality' in a world of overused words,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,"OPINION: An early frontrunner for the most-used term of the year, but what does it actually mean?","Imagine you are being pitched to. Long, hardwood table. Plush, ergonomic chair. An A5 slide decked, neatly bound and laminated, resting in front of you beside a steaming cup of coffee.
And there, in bold font, clear as day: The Long-Term Trash Equity fund.
Trash? You wouldn't buy it. Or would you? What could it possibly mean? Does it even mean anything?
This make-believe scenario is my attempt to highlight the fact that 2023 is already the year of 'quality'. In three of the last four interviews I have conducted - two chief investment officers (CIOs), an equity specialist and a CEO - the word 'quality' popped up time and time again.
But what do people mean when they talk about 'quality'? One of the CIOs laughed when I asked him why quality is being talked about so much this year.
'The thing about this industry is that a lot of terms mean different things to different people,' he said. However, quality, he added, is more strictly defined than most.
It is often used to describe companies with strong balance sheets and the ability to produce stable and dependable earnings. It is a regular feature in many factor-based investment styles alongside ideas such as growth, momentum and value, and it even has its own Wikipedia page, listing its areas of application.
Simple enough, right? But is the type of quality mentioned above the same type that everyone means when they use the word?
'No,' said the CIO. 'I have been in meetings where the term has been applied to companies with defensive earnings profiles. I have also heard it used to mean better than the worst performers - it has relative quality in that instance. It is really the job of the person speaking to get the definition correct.'
And herein lies the challenge. As someone who works with words daily, I can tell you that not everyone always uses the correct word and that words can be misinterpreted.
A much-referenced anecdote recalls the US asset manager, who I will not name, who had a long-running strategy called the Sustainable Growth Equity fund. It was launched in the mid-2000s and as the fervour around ESG grew, the fund's assets were boosted as people were drawn to the 'sustainable' banner.
However, sustainable in this context meant it was consistent over time and had no bearing on the ESG profile of the fund. I asked the company at the time whether it felt there had been sleight of hand in capturing this ESG interest when it wasn't the main purpose of the strategy, but it said the onus is on investors to understand what they are buying.
In the current market dynamics of rising rates, modest-to-improving growth, and ongoing anxiety over the war in Ukraine and China/US tensions, it is understandable that investors want to cling to 'quality' notions that can survive the worst economic outcomes.
Without preempting market trends, my gut feeling is that several strategies with 'quality' in their name will be working their way through the legal labyrinths and marketing mazes to the aforementioned pitching stage.
But, as with the sustainable fund with no interest in sustainability, I offer a word of caution around generalist terms. It might be worth asking the most basic of journalistic questions: 'What does it actually mean?'
If you cannot get an adequate or meaningful answer, then you might be better off taking a punt on my 'trash' equity fund idea. At least you won't be disappointed if it doesn't end up with quality results.
And if you're interested in the deeper philosophical meanings around the term, why not pick up Robert M Pirsig's book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance?",https://citywireselector.com/news/the-unerring-quest-for-quality-in-a-world-of-overused-words/a2409477,0

2023-02-20,a2409733,Two sector-leading stocks powering this EUR4bn European equity fund,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,Comgest's Arnaud Cosserat zeroes in on a couple of investment ideas which are providing quality and pricing power at a time of wavering certainty.,"The all-encompassing fears over inflation, coupled with the brief surge in value-driven investing, means investors have had to prioritise truly industry-leading stocks in a way they might not have done so before.
For Arnaud Cosserat, manager and chief executive officer of Comgest, this means a number of the long-standing positions in the French group's EUR4bn Comgest Growth Europe fund are starting to show their strengths.
'What we have seen across our portfolios in a period of rising inflation is that a number of stocks, not necessarily the ones we hold, have done well and part of that could be attributed to a brief rotation towards lower quality ideas, as valuations dropped and people saw what they believed to be investment opportunities.
'At some stage, inflation becomes a cost factor for all corporates and the ones we own are the ones who are able to absorb it by passing it onto the consumer by virtue of pricing power. That would be a key factor when I talk about ""quality"".
'We started to see that coming through at the beginning of last year and a number of the positions we already held were able to produce strong, double-digit growth, which would include companies such as L'Oreal. The great thing about quality is the ability they have to protect their margins in difficult markets.'
Chief among the main ideas that can ride out a more challenging environment, Paris-based Cosserat said, are Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk and Dutch semiconductor provider ASML. The stocks are the two largest positions in the Growth Europe fund according to the January factsheet, with Novo Nordisk accounting for 7.6% and ASML being a 7.9% exposure.
'The main driver for 2022 was probably inflation and 2023 could be disinflation. One of the main attributes we look for in a stock is the ability to grow earnings regardless of the cycle. We want companies that are going to go from 100-200% over a five-to-10 year spread but we need them to be able to weather short-term challenges. We are really betting on long-term growth.
'In that vein, we would discuss companies such as Novo Nordisk, which we have held for a long time and has become a leading drug manufacturer in the field of obesity, with the American market being a particular focus.
'Last year they came out with interesting products in phase three development and that could be a long-term influence on the weight-loss market. If you think, 41% of Americans are now medically obese, it is a product that helps address a serious problem and an area where they are the clear market leader.'
Connecting the dots
Cosserat added that the European equity team - which includes an array of Citywire-rated managers, including Franz Weis, Laurent Dobler, Pierre Lamelin, Sebastien Thevoux-Chabuel and Alistair Wittet - are equally bullish on ASML but took longer to pull the trigger.
'We actually discovered its potential around 20 years ago but even 15 years ago we didn't think it was quite right to buy into. We made a move in 2016 as we felt its main products were now in a sweet spot. It is so closely tied to the rapid growth in the semiconductor market and is a very keen beneficiary of Moore's Law. It has developed a $200m machine which could effectively use a laser to hit an apple on the moon, which is the level of precision it is now offering. That is market leading.
'Semiconductors is a very interesting industry, because it is only growing in importance. If you can find any company in there with genuine pricing power, then there are huge benefits, as there are so many regulatory tailwinds - I mean the CHiP Act in the US, as well as the Inflation Reduction Act will really benefit further development here.'
The managers work on a bottom-up basis, but Novo Nordisk sits within the fund's sizeable overweight to healthcare. It currently has a 29.7% exposure to the sector, while its company-assigned benchmark, MSCI Europe NR, has just 15%.
In performance terms, the Comgest Europe Growth fund sits eighth out of 94 funds in the Equity - Europe Growth sector, of those with a three-year track record to the end of January 2023. This is with a 27.8% return in euro terms, while the average fund delivered 13% over the same analysis period.",https://citywireselector.com/news/two-sector-leading-stocks-powering-this-4bn-european-equity-fund/a2409733,0

Ackman, manager of the London-listed Pershing Square Holdings (PSH ) investment trust, tweeted his support for Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur and author who heads the 'anti-woke' Strive Asset Management, a couple of days after Politico profiled the 37-year-old and his political ambitions.
'I am going to make a bold and early call,' Ackman said on Twitter, predicting that Ramaswamy 'will run for POTUS and win. I think the country is ready for his message. He is young, smart, talented and will attract the centre to the right to win. He speaks hard truths which many believe but fear to say.'
Ackman was referencing a clip of a speech Ramaswamy delivered at an event for Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative politics at colleges and high schools.
In the speech, Ramaswamy, whose parents immigrated from India, denounced the 'cultural cancer' of identity politics and the notion 'that if you're Black you're inherently disadvantaged, that if you're white you're inherently privileged.' He went on to bemoan 'the scarlet R' of being called a racist, which he said has created 'a new culture of fear in our country'.
In subsequent tweets, Ackman told his followers that 'you won't likely agree with all of (Ramaswamy's) views, but you respect his candour, acumen, discipline and energy,' while adding that 'the improbable candidate often wins'.
The founder of the Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund company, Ackman was an early backer of Strive. Ramaswamy launched the firm last year with additional backing from billionaire Peter Thiel and a handful of other wealthy individuals.
Strive's mission has been to act as an anti-ESG activist, pushing companies including ExxonMobil, Disney and Apple to focus less on social issues such as diversity or climate change and more on maximising shareholder returns.
Active political backer
Ackman has a history of political contributions to a variety of candidates in both major parties, though he typically favours Democrats over Republicans; Ramaswamy's language echoes that used by prominent GOP politicians such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - and the two may end up competing with each other, former President Donald Trump and a slew of other Republicans for the party's 2024 presidential nomination.
Ackman in February 2016 called on former New York City mayor and fellow billionaire Mike Bloomberg to run for president (he didn't, though Bloomberg went on to run unsuccessfully in 2020).
Ackman said in November 2016 that he was 'very bullish on Trump'. In 2020, though, he butted heads with the then-President over the Republican's approach to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Ackman reportedly got into a heated back-and-forth with President Joe Biden in 2017 at the SkyBridge Alternatives (Salt) Conference, where the then-former vice president and the investor were featured speakers.
Most of Ackman's contributions in recent years have gone to winning Democratic candidates in tight races, including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet and Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, according to Federal Election Commission records.
Ackman also has donated to The Great Task, a political action committee led by former Representative Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who bucked her party's trend and supported Trump's impeachment for his role in the 6 January 2021 riots; and to Win the Era, a PAC tied to presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who went on to become Biden's transportation secretary after bowing out in the 2020 primaries.
Ackman did not financially back any 2020 presidential candidate, according to FEC records. He previously gave money to the campaigns of former president Barack Obama in 2008 and Senator Mitt Romney in 2012.
Others are not as keen on Ramaswamy's political prospects, including political commentator Josh Barro, who predicted in response to Ackman that 'normal people have never heard of (Ramaswamy) and will never notice his presidential campaign'.
'Americans are reacting with one voice (to) the Ramaswamy for President campaign, and they are saying, ""Who?""' Barro wrote on Twitter. 'And then when he says he's going to fight the scourge of ESG investing, they are saying ""What?""'

ESG in the firing line
Ramaswamy's longshot presidential bid comes amid a backlash against ESG investing led by Republican state officials in several states.
Politico reported that Ramaswamy considered but eventually decided against running for US Senate in his home state of Ohio in recent years.
Since 2020, Ramaswamy has contributed more than $89,000 to various political campaigns, according to FEC records. That includes at least $10,000 each to a fund dedicated to helping the GOP win Senate seats in Georgia in 2020; the main fundraising platform of the Republican National Committee; and the Ohio Republican Party State Central & Executive Committee.
Since launching Strive last year, Ramaswamy's firm has put eight exchange-traded funds in the field which have collectively amassed more than $600m in roughly half a year, according to data from Morningstar Direct.
The bulk of that is concentrated in the $399m Strive US Energy ETF (DRLL), which secured most of its inflows in its first month. That's followed by the $120m Strive 500 ETF (STRV) and a smattering of assets in other strategies.

Only 24% of 1,007 US adults responding to American Century Investments's sixth global impact investing survey said the recent ESG backlash has affected their appetite for impact products, compared with 31% of respondents in the UK and 53% in Singapore.
'Despite the backlash, we largely see that people continue to show more interest in impact investing year after year,' said Sarah Bratton Hughes, head of sustainable investing at American Century Investments.
The survey also found that millennials have been more affected by the anti-ESG developments than boomers or Gen X, with 32% of US millennials saying it had changed their interest in impact investing.
Overall, however, impact investing demand among US respondents dropped to 56% in 2022, marking a five percentage point decline since 2021. Commenting on this drop, Bratton Hughes said the long-term increase is more relevant than the short-term blip; in 2016, just 38% of respondents were interested in impact investing.
'The numbers were according to our expectations. The backlash is dominating the headlines, and you're also seeing a rise of greenhushing and a drop in greenwashing concerns in the US - because companies are understating their green credentials due to the backlash,' she said.
Asking about impact investing as opposed to ESG also matters, she added.
'Right now with the backlash, words matter. Impacting investing is clearer to people than ESG. People understand that you're trying to invest for a dual return, and the concept is historically more established than ESG.
Anti-exclusion, not anti-ESG
Presently, more than half of the country - 26 US states - have current or proposed anti-ESG regulation, according to Bratton Hughes.
'The anti-ESG debate is turning into a mainstream-vs-Wall Street debate, where the term ESG is being attached to Wall Street and there's a large disconnect to what we're seeing happening in the mainstream. A 2022 survey by Finra, the securities regulatory body for retail investors, found that only 21% of investors with a taxable investment account actually knew what ESG stands for,' she said.
One of the states leading the anti-ESG crusade is Texas. Bratton Hughes, however, doesn't believe that makes the state 'anti-environment'.
'They're anti exclusions, and for energy independence. Over the longer term, we feel Texas is going to be crucial in the world's decarbonisation. If it was a country on its own, it'd be the fifth largest producer of renewable energy globally; it's the largest US producer of wind power, and it just overtook California as the largest solar energy producer.
'Texas doesn't have a renewables issue, but a just transition issue. There are more renewable energy jobs in Texas than in the legacy fossil fuel industry, but the issue is that they're lower skill, lower paying jobs replacing higher skill, higher paying jobs.'
Additionally, the anti-ESG states are also set to become some of the strongest beneficiaries of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act due to the rapidly forming 'battery belt' in the Midwest and South, aimed at bringing EV battery production closer to home.
The lesson for European asset managers with business in the US, Bratton Hughes said, is that the US thinks about top-down exclusions very differently from Europe and considers it as something which could breach the US view on fiduciary duty.",https://citywireselector.com/news/us-impact-investing-appetite-unharmed-by-anti-esg-backlash/a2409757,0
2023-02-20,a2409781,UK regulator outlines vision to overhaul funds regime,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Robin Amos,"The FCA has made a raft of suggestions to improve the UK funds system, from investor engagement to altering Ucits rules, but says it will listen to the industry.","The FCA has outlined its vision to improve fund firms' engagement with investors through better use of technology in a wider regulatory effort to improve the state of the UK funds industry.
In a 48-page discussion paper published this morning, 'Updating and improving the UK regime for asset management', the regulator outlined a raft of proposals for the investment industry - some to do with specific rules, others suggesting broader revisions.
The proposals, which have not been cemented, say portfolio managers should upgrade their technology to 'restore balance' to the interest of investors.
The FCA suggested new rules to encourage the use of technology to improve investor engagement, which it identified as a weak spot in its current regime.
'Our rules may no longer achieve their aim of ensuring a fair balance between the interests of the investor and the fund manager,' the paper stated.
It argues that, given progress in technology, investors 'have a right to expect more timely and well-presented information' than when standards in this area were established a generation ago.
Specific ideas included customers of platforms being enabled to take part in virtual meetings and to vote on proposals by the funds they own units in.
'Unitholder meetings are an important fund governance mechanism, allowing participants in a fund to approve or reject strategic proposals such as a future change to its investment aims, or a merger with another fund,' the FCA said.
'These meetings ought to maximise opportunities for investors to participate and have their voices heard. Rules that fail to recognise the presence of the intermediate unitholder may inadvertently disenfranchise investors, at the same time making it difficult for fund managers to deliver changes in a timely way.'
Other suggestions included simplifying fund prospectuses, requiring them to clarify the investment strategy and be provided in an easily accessible, machine-readable format.
'Prospectuses are generally written in legal, technical language, often including generic elements such as a copy-out of FCA rules,' the paper said. 'The term ""prospectus"" is itself rather opaque and unhelpful, which might deter some investors from accessing the document.'
Prospectuses could also potentially be stored in a central repository, such as the FCA's National Storage Mechanism, accessible by the public.
Investment Association chief executive Chris Cummings said the trade body supported the FCA's goal of cncouraging innovation in the industry, but argued this should not undermine the industry's competitiveness.
'As the FCA acknowledges, this is already a highly regulated sector, and our members are working hard to manage and implement a busy regulatory agenda. The need for any further regulation must therefore be balanced against ensuring the UK remains a global competitive jurisdiction and an attractive place to do business,' he said.
'We welcome the FCA's consultative approach and will work with the regulator and our members to identify areas where there could be clear benefits from regulatory reform.'
Overhaul of Ucits regime
The paper also proposed simplifying and consolidating the rules around Ucits vehicles.
The changes would see the FCA abolish the regulatory distinction between a firm's fund management and portfolio management activities, 'except where differing treatment is appropriate'.
'One effect of the duplication of rules is that the current rule framework often leads to identical or broadly similar activities being regulated to a slightly different standard,' the paper said. 'Different rules apply depending on whether a firm is managing a segregated portfolio for an individual client, an alternative investment fund, or a Ucits fund.'
Such areas include the rules surrounding portfolio managers' due diligence and the requirement to consider the risk of their activities to financial stability.
The FCA said the rules currently 'arguably enable' firms to manage multiple individual portfolios without complying with some rules applicable to fund managers, which it said could pose risks to investors.
However, the paper added that given the time and resources necessary to change the regime, it 'may not be appropriate' to prioritise this over other issues.
Changes to liquidity rules
The paper also proposed changing the rules around liquidity, requiring Ucits funds to take more caution with illiquid investments.
It suggested the FCA could prevent managers from using the 10% allowance in portfolios for unlisted investments 'in a way that undermines the liquidity of the fund'.
Ucits funds could also be required to carve out liquidity 'buckets', as alternative funds are obliged to do, and perform liquidity stress testing.
The FCA was widely criticised for not acting sooner in the case of the collapse of Woodford Investment Management. The firm's flagship Woodford Equity Income Ucits was unable to meet redemptions after breaching the 10% rule on unquoted investments.",https://citywireselector.com/news/uk-regulator-outlines-vision-to-overhaul-funds-regime/a2409781,1

The index was flat at 8,003 and the pound hovered at $1.20 to the dollar as traders waited for the release of US personal consumption expenditure data on Thursday, which could influence the Federal Reserve's next step on interest rates in the fight against inflation. Wall Street is closed today for Presidents' Day.
In London, banks were buoyed by any potential for interest rate rises, with Barclays (BARC) up 1.5%, or 2p, at 176p and Lloyds (LLOY) adding 1%, or 5p, to trade at 51p.
This week also marks the close of the reporting season for banks. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said that it had been 'mixed so far on immediate prospects rather than the undoubted underlying capital strengths which are being displayed'.
HSBC (HSBA) reports tomorrow and Lloyds will release numbers on Wednesday.
Hunter said that the FTSE 'remains protected by its mixture of defensive, higher-yielding shares, with additional exposure to banks which are seeing the benefit of rising interest rates and mineral stocks which are poised to pounce on recovering demand from China as the year progresses'.
Miner Anglo American (AAL) was up 1.2% at PS32.48, followed by Rio Tinto (RIO) up 1.1% at PS61.72, and Glencore (GLEN) up 0.8% at 514p.
Sports Direct owner Frasers (FRAS) was the biggest FTSE riser, up 2.7%, or 21p, at 791p after launching an PS80m share buy-back in a bid to bolster the share price following the departure of Mike Ashley.
Susannah Streeter, head of markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said markets were still cautious but the FTSE 100 was expected to cling onto the 'psychologically important' 8,000 level.
'The pound is wavering on the edge of $1.20 as investors assess the direction of Fed policy and also the chances of Britain breaking the deadlock on talks with the EU over trade,' Streeter said.
The FTSE 250 was equally lacklustre this morning, remaining flat at 20,089. Payment solutions provider Network International (NETW) was the biggest riser, up 2.9% at 295p, followed by engineering group Senior (SNR), which added 2.6% to trade at 155p, and promotional printing group 4imprint (FOUR), which was up 1.7% at PS46.60.

The new fund will provide exposure to the event driven specialist's primary investment strategies in a daily liquidity Ucits format, using the expertise of its ten-man investment team.

The firm has also entered fresh talks to sell its fund administration business after a previous bid collapsed last year.
In an announcement this morning, Link said it had recognised an impairment of A$449m (PS257.4m), with FCA negotiations over a looming penalty now at an advanced stage.
Last year the UK watchdog announced that it was seeking a PS306m redress bill, as well as a PS50m penalty, over the role of Link Fund Solutions (LFS) in the collapse of the Woodford Equity Income fund.
In response, Link Group said it would challenge this potential penalty through the courts and did not set aside any provision for it in its financial statements.
However, this morning the FCA said its negotiations with Link Group had reached an advanced stage, and would 'determine whether the FCA's proposed enforcement action against LFS can be resolved by agreement'.
The regulator said it would lay out how a redress scheme would work for investors as soon as it was able.
To assist with the possible settlement agreement, it has given Link Group time to sell assets to meet its concerns.
Sale talks
In a separate statement on the Australian Securities Exchange, Link Group announced that it was in exclusive negotiations with Irish asset management services firm Waystone over the sale of LFS.
Last year Link Group's deal to sell LFS to Dye & Durham collapsed on the back of the FCA's demands for redress.
But today Link Group said the new deal to sell LFS to Waystone would exclude any Woodford-related liabilities.
It said that if both the FCA settlement and the sale to Waystone were agreed then it would receive 'no net proceeds' from the sale, suggesting the valuation of LFS would be the same as the FCA penalty being negotiated.
Link Group also said it would impair, or write down, LFS's assets.
It said there could be no guarantee that it would conclude either the sale to Waystone or the FCA settlement.
Last month Waystone announced that private equity house Montagu and software services investor Hg had invested in the company in a bid to scale the Irish firm's fund services business globally.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/link-faces-257m-hit-as-fca-woodford-probe-nears-end/a2409723,0
2023-02-20,a2408679,EM equity trio plot route back after chastening year,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Daniel Ruiz,"William Blair IM's Casey Preyss explains how riding post-pandemic tech impaired performance, but the manager believes China and financials are the next waves to catch.","For many years, Citywire Selector ran a monthly feature called Performance Clinic, which examined a tough period of performance for a portfolio manager and how they addressed it.
This month, we speak to William Blair Investment Management's Casey Preyss.
The William Blair Emerging Markets Growth
fund didn't have a good 2022.
The strategy previously sat in the upper quartiles of the Equity - Global Emerging Markets sector but has now fallen to the lower end of the performance table.
The $670m strategy is overseen by the trio Casey Preyss, Todd McClone and Vivian Lin Thurston. Over a short timeframe, it fell 33% over the 12 months compared to an average decline of 22.1%. However, on a three year-basis, it is down 6.2%, while the average peer lost 10.5%.
'Value has outperformed growth very strongly last year, and that's a headwind for growth investors like us,' Preyss said.
'But we're at a point now where that headwind has somewhat dissipated, and we have a much more optimistic view on EM compared to last year.'
The opinion that EM stocks might have bottomed, and subsequently will soon see a rebound, could well be shared among other managers. Valuations in EM derated substantially over 2022, as appetite for risk diminished amid increasing recession fears and rising rates.
Investing in the emerging world proved not to be for the faint of heart last year, with only five funds managing to post positive returns over the calendar year.
The sharp swing away from growth was an added factor, alongside growing EM aversion, Preyss said. In addition, the strategy had a substantial allocation to tech hardware.
'Taiwan and Korean tech had a pretty considerable slowdown in the semiconductor space, and that was an overweight position for us,' Preyss said.
In December 2021, the William Blair EM Growth fund had 37% exposed to tech, which was up from 27% in November 2020, according to Morningstar data. However, as tech stocks receded, the fund's allocation to the sector diminished, with only 17% invested here by October 2022.
Preyss said the fund is now market-weight in terms of tech, but the nature of its investing style comes to the fore when thinking ahead. 'Semiconductors have bottomed and we're looking at very attractive valuations, so we're marginally adding back to tech hardware,' he explained.
China comeback
With China exiting its zero Covid policy, Preyss believes the country will outperform other economies, as the US and Europe are still measuring how hard the economy's landing will be.
'China is off cycle from the rest of the world,' he said. 'We're definitely focused on investing directly in Chinese high-growth companies. It was the weakest performing area of last year. So, if you see a recovery in China, that's a key driver for strong performance in emerging markets.'
Preyss is keeping a close eye on regulatory developments around the US, as well as geopolitical risk regarding Taiwan, which remains a concern. 'The reopening from Covid will be bumpy and volatile,' he admits. 'But it's moving in the right direction.'
The fund repositioned over the latter months of last year and started 2023 with a 10% increase to China, which was mainly through consumer and tourism stocks. Morningstar shows the fund having 17% of the portfolio allocated to China as of November 2022, which is the most recently available data.
'We're focused on the internet,' Preyss explains. 'The names that will benefit immediately from a consumption recovery. There's a lot of pent-up demand and money ready to be spent.'
At a sector level, the fund has progressively increased allocation to financial services companies since the start of 2022. In December 2021 it had 15% invested here, which rose to 25% by November 2022. 'We've added to financial services in Indonesia, the Philippines and UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,' Preyss said.
Meanwhile, at a country level, he expects Indonesia to benefit from higher commodity prices, while the Philippines are seen taking advantage of increasing tourism.
'Indonesia and India, that's going to be kind of consumer banking, consumer financials, which is just getting really driven by the under penetration of financial services,' Preyss said. 'As those economies recover, those banks are positioned to do well.
'Relative financials in the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, they tend to be sort of the most liquid stocks in that region.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/em-equity-trio-plot-route-back-after-chastening-year/a2408679,4

A deal could be made in the next couple of months and could value the unit at around PS250m.
At least one other party has been in discussions in recent weeks to buy the PS14bn (EUR15.7bn) private equity business, Sky News reported.
The news that Abrdn had put its private equity business up for sale was first reported in July, when investment bankers at Rothschild were appointed to find a buyer.
The sale is part of CEO Stephen Bird's efforts to streamline the business.
Although the asset manager, which has previously declined to comment on the reports, is set to offload its private equity business, Abrdn is still committed to private markets.
In an interview with Citywire Amplify last month, Abrdn's global head of real assets and private credit investment specialists Neil Meikle said private credit and real assets are a key strategic growth priority for the business.
Abrdn had PS2.9bn in private credit assets at the end of June and PS42.7bn in real assets. Overall, its alternatives business has about PS80bn.
Abrdn, which has in the region of PS508bn in assets under management in total, launched a dedicated private markets arm in September 2019 and restructured the leadership team.
Bird became CEO of the business in September 2020 and has been working on simplifying the company.",https://citywireselector.com/news/abrdn-in-talks-with-santander-to-sell-14bn-private-equity-arm/a2409795,1
2023-02-20,a2409666,Why Mirova is targeting off-grid electricity in rural Africa,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,The French sustainability firm recently acquired a Nairobi-based specialist solar power lender and sees off-grid renewables as a strong investment and impact opportunity.,"Mirova plans to expand its emerging markets exposure in 2023, and one area it is looking at is renewable energy in Africa.
Raphael Lance, head of energy transition funds at Mirova, told Citywire Selector that the continent is often forgotten by emerging market investors despite its green financing needs.
'There is a need to grow [renewable] energy production in Europe, but the need to do so in emerging markets is even bigger - they don't just need renewable energy, they need energy as a whole. Access to energy is key for the development of education, women's emancipation, agriculture... Without energy, there's not much you can do,' said Lance.
He highlighted that Africa has 60% of the world's best solar resources, but only 1% of solar PV cell capacity installed, according to the International Energy Agency's 2022 World Energy Outlook. This issue poses a significant challenge given that African electricity demand will increase by an estimated 75% by 2030.
Last year, Mirova announced its 100% acquisition of SunFunder, an emerging markets clean energy and climate investment specialist firm and the number one lender for distributed solar energy in Africa. Lance said the acquisition was made to enhance the firm's presence on the continent.
'We started to have some projects in Kenya and other African countries but didn't have any people on the ground. SunFunder provides the opportunity of having an emerging market platform for the energy transition - not just Africa, because it also does projects in East Asia - as well as strong knowledge of Africa.'
Going off-grid
SunFunder provides direct finance to unlisted companies installing home solar panels and this is crucial to these firms' business models.
'The way the companies that install the home solar system get paid is by subscription; they amortise the installation cost over say, three years. This creates a lot of capital needs for the companies; they have to pay their suppliers straight away, but do not get paid straight away by their consumers. It creates a gap. What SunFunder does is to bridge that gap.'
Off-grid solutions such as those SunFunder finances are a theme that runs through other unlisted investments made by Mirova.
The firm has provided more than $25m of debt financing to D.Light, a leading manufacturer and distributor of off-grid solar products. Mirova estimates this investment has resulted in improved energy access for over 5.3 million people in Kenya, Mauritius, India and other countries. Mirova also provided a $2m construction finance loan to UK-based Winch Energy, a mini-grid developer that has created a proprietary containerised remote power unit, to enable the company to solarise 25 villages in North Uganda.
'Large parts of Africa don't have a centralised energy grid. 50 megawatt of solar panels in the African countryside would completely destroy the energy grid, or at least destabilise it, because there's so little power on the grid,' said Lance.
'Of course, in big cities, you have energy grids. Where you have capital and mainstream investors in Africa is in those large utility-scale projects. If there's a large solar or hydro plant in Cote d'Ivoire, then there'll be a lot of available capital. But it's not answering the need for decentralised energy. You just bring energy to where it already exists - it's useful, but just one part of the answer,' said Lance.
German bund-comparable
Mirova has managed energy transition funds for 20 years. It launched its first dedicated emerging markets energy transition infrastructure fund in 2013, which grew to $15m before closing three years later. The fourth vintage of the fund, the Mirova Gigaton fund, was launched last year and targets EUR500m in assets.
Being a layered fund, it comprises three tranches: a 'super senior tranche' of institutional investors, which is safeguarded by a political risk insurance; a senior trance of development finance institutions aided by a $50m portfolio guarantee from Swedish development cooperation agency Sida; and a junior and first-loss tranche of donors, high-net-worth individuals and impact investors, protected by a forex hedging facility.
When asked about the risk profile, Lance said that the senior tranche is exposed to a 'quite low' level of risk because of the level of protection granted by the junior tranche. He also said the fund, aside from business-to-consumer companies like SunFunder, also invests in business-to-business companies with stronger credit quality.
'More and more large institutions have an impact pocket. They are ready to invest, maybe, in a more risky environment where there is a lot of impact,' Lance said.
'There is maybe a 5-10% loss at the end. Then we also have some intervention and guarantees by organisations like Sida. So it is packaged in a way that for senior investors, it's an acceptable risk. They can almost get as much [coupon] investing into German bonds today,' he added.
The Mirova Gigawatt fund pays a 4% coupon to the senior tranche, whereas the German 10-year government bond has a 2.4% yield as of 17 February.
'We offered 4% when the interest rates were at zero, so it's a bit lower compared to what it should be, given today's interest rates,' Lance added.
'We are thinking about ways to slightly increase the remuneration of the senior tranche, but the question is whether the market can increase the interest rate downstream to its clients - what we don't want, and can't afford, are loans that are so expensive to companies that it could break their investment models.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/why-mirova-is-targeting-off-grid-electricity-in-rural-africa/a2409666,0
2023-02-20,a2409694,Jefferies reiterates 'buy' on M&G as funds outperform,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,John Schaffer,Analysts say a 'remarkable turnaround' in fund performance could drive future inflows and boost shares by 17%.,"Analysts at Jefferies have reiterated their 'buy' recommendation on M&G on the back of 87% of its equity funds beating their benchmarks last year in a 'remarkable turnaround'.
The broker set a target price on the asset manager of 235p, which is 17% higher than the current share price of 200p.
'Based on our analysis, the majority of equity fund AUM [assets under management] has also outperformed on both a three-year (62% ahead of the benchmark) and five-year view (62%), up to the end of 2022,' said Jefferies analyst James Pearse in a note.
'The strong performance in 2022 has led to a significant improvement in M&G's equity fund performance metrics. When we initiated on M&G [in November] last year, only 41% of funds that we track were ahead of the benchmark over the one-year period up to the end of 2021, 33% over three years, and 30% over five years.'
Jefferies suggested that short-term outperformance would be attractive for retail investors and was a lead indicator for likely net inflows in the future.
Over 12 months, M&G's share price has dipped by nearly 6%. That's broadly similar to rival Legal & General, which is down 4.6%, and far less severe than Aviva, which has dipped 21.4%.
Second-half outflow pain
Despite the optimism on fund performance, Jefferies estimates that M&G suffered PS0.9bn of net outflows in the second half of 2022. This was based on PS52bn of M&G's external AUM that Jefferies monitors.
The redemption pain was driven largely by fixed income mandates, with investors pulling PS0.9bn from the division. The firm's PS10.1bn Optimal Income
fund is estimated to have had net outflows of PS0.7bn in the second half of last year.
However, there were encouraging inflows into equity and multi-asset funds, which are all expected to record net inflows of PS0.3bn.
Among larger strategies that have displayed strong performance over a year are the PS5.3bn Global Dividend , the PS3.3bn Global Listed Infrastructure , and the PS1.3bn European Strategic Value funds, which are all more than 10% ahead of their benchmarks.
EPS downgrade
Due to M&G's dip in AUM, Jefferies has also downgraded its earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates for the firm.
It has dropped its full-year 2022 EPS estimate by 4% to 34.1p, while its 2023 estimate has fallen 6% to 16.8p.
The broker also predicts that M&G will report revenues of PS995m for 2022, rising to just above PS1bn for 2023. That's above the turnover of PS953m that M&G reported in 2021.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/jefferies-reiterates-buy-on-mandg-as-funds-outperform/a2409694,6

2023-02-20,a2409734,Corporate bond chief: Medium-rated credit offers investor 'sweet spot',Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Krystle Higgins,"Vontobel's Christian Hantel reveals the BBB-rated firms he is betting on, and why rating deterioration plays on his mind more than credit defaults.","The current sweet spot within the corporate bond market lies within companies with a medium credit rating, which currently offer a better risk return profile.
That is according to Christian Hantel, manager of the Vontobel Global Corporate Mid Yield Bond
fund.
Speaking to Citywire Selector, Hantel said when you compare how bonds are being priced, BBBs look more compelling than others, such as BBs which he said look too expensive right now. This is why he has chosen to be underweight in AAA bonds, and more selective with BB rated firms.
'It comes down to how attractive the risk return profile is. The credit risk is higher, but you get better compensation.'
Current BBB picks for Hantel are more cyclical businesses, such as the auto sector, and some large-cap companies.
'General Motors or Ford tends to be in the lower rating category. Then you have large-cap structures such as AT&T or Verizon which are actually doing fine, but are rated lower because they have so much debt. Both have stable cash flows, but they must also constantly make sure their leverage remains in check.'
Hantel is currently focused on investment grade companies, with two distinct types falling within that, rising stars and subordinated bonds.
'Rising stars are companies moving up from high yield to investment grade. It's important to capture this early because the spread tightening takes place at the early stage, and not when the bond is upgraded.
'The other component within this 'bucket' is subordinated bonds from highly rated financial institutions.'
Default risks
Typically, defaults are more of a topic for high yield investors with holdings in firms rated below BBB, said Hantel.
'That is why a lot of investors make a clear cut decision not to be invested in high yield companies, because they see the probability of default increasing significantly.'
Hantel said that while investors who hold investment grade firms are usually safe from defaults, he added that there are exceptions; pointing to the Lehman Brothers crash, now emblematic of the 2007/2008 financial crash. Or the more recent 2020 collapse of Wirecard.
Hantel said he is more focused on monitoring the risk of deteriorating ratings.
'Deteriorating ratings, perhaps down from BBB to BB is something we look at very carefully, because, not only does the default probability increase. So does the refinancing cost, making it much more expensive for companies to refinance into high yield territory.'
Looking towards macroeconomic risks, Hantel said he thinks the bond market is in good shape this year, due to the likelihood in his mind of a softer recession than experienced back in 2007. Which he accredits to the current consumer strength and a strong job market.",https://citywireselector.com/news/corporate-bond-chief-medium-rated-credit-offers-investor-sweet-spot/a2409734,2

Through the collaboration, MSCI will distribute the nature and biodiversity analytics firm's data and analysis software to the global investment community.
The data will cover all constituents of the MSCI ACWI index, with the aim of helping clients:
Better identify exposure to higher-risk companies, industries and operations from a nature and biodiversity perspective;
Strengthen engagement with portfolio companies and stakeholders;
Provide more comprehensive reporting in response to regulation, such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and the evolving Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).
The partnership follows the formation of the Global Biodiversity Framework at COP15 in Montreal in December.
Further joint projects
NatureAlpha and MSCI have also agreed to work together on research projects and potentially develop more methodologies and tools, such as a 'Biodiversity Footprint' metric based on advanced lifecycle analysis methodologies to help investors measure the absolute or relative impact of their investments.
NatureAlpha founder Vian Sharif said: 'With over half of the world's GDP dependent on nature, financial exposure to risks from nature loss is significant and accountability is greater than ever.
'We are proud to work with such an established and credible collaborator and look forward to enhancing our methodologies to provide biodiversity impact and nature risk solutions for the corporate universe at scale.'
Arne Klug, vice-president and biodiversity research director at MSCI ESG Research, said: 'Global biodiversity challenges have tangible impacts on the ways in which companies across industries function now and in the future.
'Therefore, investor demand for advanced data and tools to address biodiversity risks and impact is growing. MSCI's collaboration with NatureAlpha will help our clients better identify and assess impacts and risks from nature loss in their portfolios.'
NatureAlpha's platform provides advanced biodiversity data and analytical tools which use curated datasets in line with internationally agreed goals within the Convention for Biological Diversity, International Union for Conservation of Nature and the TNFD developing framework.
It also includes year-on-year intelligence on nature and biodiversity status and historical losses, including satellite-generated insights via a user interface.
An integrated biodiversity assessment tool was added to the platform last month, providing access to data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species, the World Database on Protected Areas and the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas.",https://citywireselector.com/news/msci-teams-up-with-biodiversity-analytics-firm-to-boost-eco-data-access/a2409872,0

The main index initally slipped 0.6%, or 48 points, to 7,965 as disappointing figures fed through, pushing the FTSE 100 below its new milestone level of 8,000. It later stabilised at 7,998, off 0.02%.
Leading the falls were mining stocks, as Chilean copper miner Antofagasta slashed its dividend by almost 60% to $0.597 (PS0.49) a share as rising inflation saw input costs rise 10% and revenues fall 22% to $5.9bn. Shares were trading down 2.7%, or 48p, at PS17.12.
Precious metals miners had made gains on the back of the Chinese reopening and expectations for increased demand, meaning this could just be a blip for Antofagasta.
Adam Vettese, analyst at eToro said: 'The fact that many economists are now predicting that the US and Europe will have a shallower recession - or even avoid one altogether - should also be supportive of metal prices.
'Therefore, if Antofagasta can avoid any major disruption to its production processes, we should see copper and gold production increase in 2023.'
Fellow miner Anglo American (AAL) was the biggest faller, shedding 3.6%, or 120p, to PS32.17, while Glencore (GLEN) shed 1.7% to 510p.
HSBC bank was another big faller, dropping 1.7%, or 10p, to 610p despite a 90% jump in profits in the final three months of 2022 to PS4.3bn. The shares were hit by annual results that showed profits were down by PS1.2bn to PS14.6bn following the sale of its retail bank in France.
There was some positive economic news to offset the disappointing corporate figures, with the Office for National Statistics reporting that the government ran a surprise surplus in the public finances of PS5.4bn in January thanks to a boost from self-assessment tax payments. Although the figure is smaller than the PS7.1bn run in January 2022, it is larger than the PS5bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility.
AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said the surplus 'provides a boost to chancellor Jeremy Hunt ahead of his Budget next month - perhaps allowing him to be a little more Santa than Scrooge when he unveils his tax and spending plans'.
The FTSE 250 also retreated 0.6%, or 123 points, to 19,9974, led lower by Wizz Air (WIZZ). The budget airline dropped 4.3%, or 117p, to PS25.60 after being named the UK's worst airline for summer holiday delays by the Civil Aviation Authority.
Comparison site Moneysupermarket (MONY) gave up 3.2% to 226p, while investment bank Close Brothers (CBG) lost 3.1% to trade at 969p.
Among investment companies, Petershill Partners (PHLL ) was up 1.1% at 165p, while SDCL Energy Efficiency Income (SEIT ) added 0.9% to trade at 94p, and HgCapital (HGT ) was up 0.9% at 373p.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/ftse-slips-on-antofagasta-dividend-cut-hsbc-profits-surge/a2409848,10
2023-02-21,a2409888,David Stevenson: The lazy investor's route to good asset allocation,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,David Stevenson,"As a prelude to unveiling his Lazy Alternative Funds Portfolio using investment companies and trusts, our columnist updates his balanced growth portfolio using ETFs.","In my experience, investors are terrifically interested in the minutiae of investing - which broker to use, which fund structure to put their money in - but their eyes glaze over when talk turns to asset allocation.
Perhaps it's the term itself. Asset allocation sounds jargony but most studies by academics suggest the majority of future returns can be predicted by the quality of thinking an investor puts into the subject.
What do we mean by asset allocation? In simple terms, we have a bunch of asset classes - equities, bonds, commodities, alternatives - and you work out how to allocate which percentage of your portfolio to each category and the inevitable sub-categories (US equities vs emerging equities and so on).
In my humble opinion, everything starts from this set of decisions and then you work back to the right mix of funds and online wrap structures.
This asset allocation thinking should also influence how you value each part of the investment process. Let's break the cost structure down into its main components: asset allocation, funds and the platform.
The value chain
Increasingly, the cost of running a fund - which contains a diversified mix of shares or bonds that invest in your asset class - is being driven downwards inexorably. Nowadays, if you are paying more than 1.5% for a fund structure on an annual basis, you are almost certainly paying over the odds unless there is some special skillset being provided plus bumper returns, or you are investing in a complex and difficult-to-access market.
Over in index-tracking land, most mainstream passive funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) offer access to a broad, diversified asset class for 20 basis points (0.2%) or less a year.
The next key element is the wrapper - the distribution structure - that houses all your funds and individual stocks. This usually means some kind of platform that wraps around your investments, probably online. Again, the downward pressure on costs is relentless and over time you should expect this to cost less than 25 basis points - anything more than 1% is frankly not worth the money.
This brings us to the last element - the provision of all that asset allocation wisdom. This is definitely worth paying for if it delivers. Those academics I mentioned earlier have run the numbers, and if you get a brilliant practitioner, as much as 90% of total long-term returns can be traced back to 'wise' asset allocation.
Simple approach
But as with all active investment management, you need to be rigorous and methodical in tracking those above-average returns - logic and research suggest most asset allocators add only a tiny bit of extra value over the long term.
By comparison, simplistic target risk- and target age-based structures tend to deliver consistent long-term returns at a much lower cost. The example most commentators like me point to is the Vanguard Lifestrategy funds range, which offers a collection of inexpensive ETFs in an ISA or pension, with asset allocation based on a sliding scale that starts at 100% global equities and progressively increases the fixed income component depending on how low the risk level is. It's a simple idea, elegantly executed, with all costs running at around 32 basis points.
But this approach doesn't always work and sometimes it pays to think more creatively about how you run asset allocation. Obviously, you could pay some clever pointy-heads to run the asset allocation for you. But there are alternatives, all of which are free.
Lazy way
I have long been a fan of the 'lazy portfolio' concept. This takes the writings and thoughts of a well-known investor - say, David Swensen of Yale University fame - and turns them into a simple collection of cheap ETFs to produce a diversified model portfolio.
The US Bogleheads website runs a great resource if you are interested in this idea. All you need to do is find the UK-listed equivalents to the US funds featured. You can find an even greater range of ideas at another US website called PortfoliosLab.
I'm such a big fan of the lazy approach that in September 2020 I launched a handful of model portfolios here on Citywire - an Adventurous Portfolio of ETFs and a Global Trends ETF portfolio. I recently checked in on how they are doing.
The idea was to assemble no more than 10 easy-to-trade ETFs that would appeal to long-term, growth-oriented investors. While performance has been fine (the Adventurous portfolio was up 11% since launch, though the Global Trends portfolio was up only 8%), you would probably have done better by investing in a simple global equities ETF that tracks the MSCI ACWI index or, even better, an actively managed closed-end fund such as Alliance Trust (ATST ).
That said, my model portfolios are meant to be for the long term, and I would hope that the thinking behind them should/might win out over the long term.
My point in emphasising lazy model portfolios is that they are free; you don't pay for the asset allocation. Nearly all lazy portfolios are by default relatively simplistic and not very dynamic - the whole point is not to overthink the asset allocation ideas.
Algo-Chain
But what happens if you want a slightly more dynamic approach for free? Last week ETF provider HANetf launched a series of model portfolios with specialist provider Algo-Chain. According to the press release, they 'use state-of-the-art technology to screen extensive market, macroeconomic and ETF data sets from around the world. This is used alongside a human overlay to determine economic cycles and risk appetite in the markets and to capture the risk premia across various asset classes.' The portfolios will be rebalanced every quarter.
A few readers might have heard of HANetfs' extensive range of thematic ETFs, but not Algo-Chain. It's run by ex-BlackRock iShares experts and targets wealth advisers and other professionals with its asset allocation ideas. I rate its principles highly but the reason for mentioning this new range of model portfolios is that you can look at the portfolios online and copy them yourself.
I'd focus most attention on the Balanced, Adventurous and Growth portfolios. In the table below I have listed the constituents of the Balanced portfolio. It's a long list - 16 funds - and although it does include some small allocations to HANetf products, the main bulk of the funds are not tied to the fund manager and are dirt cheap and easy to access.
I would wager this is an excellent starter for adventurous types who want a more dynamic approach to building their portfolios at low cost, using ETFs without paying for the asset allocation expertise.

What about investment trusts?
That leaves me with one last question - what would a lazy portfolio of actively managed investment trusts look like?
Active managers provide exactly the kind of asset allocation overlay that is worth paying for but, in model portfolio terms, it's a bit trickier drawing up a list of, say, 16 investment companies for a global equities or balanced portfolio.
You could get individual closed-end funds to cover each market from US equities to Asian equities if you want a global equities portfolio, but in the tradition of lazy investing, you're probably best off using just one global fund such as Alliance Trust or Witan (WTAN ) to do all the hard asset allocation thinking, or perhaps JPMorgan Global Growth and Income (JGGI ) for a more income-focused approach.
In the balanced segment of the market, you could just build a model portfolio that comprises the three most popular, multi-asset cautious funds - Personal Assets (PNL ), Capital Gearing (CGT ) and the Ruffer Investment Company (RICA ). The combination of these three would get you a lively and dynamic mix of asset classes and strategies.
Where it gets more complicated is if you want to build an Alternatives Portfolio. That is, a model portfolio producing some income but that focuses on absolute returns, with individual funds that might move in a different direction to mainstream equities and bonds.
Here the choice of funds is much more difficult as there are so many to choose from. I'll return to this subject in a fortnight with a suggested Lazy Alternative Funds Portfolio.

2023-02-21,a2409879,EM investors ignoring alpha potential of ex-China strategies,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Krystle Higgins,Eastspring's Navin Hingorani says China's index dominance could see investors miss out on unloved value stocks within other emerging markets.,"Emerging market investors could lose out by failing to invest in ex-China strategies.
This is according to Navin Hingorani, manager of the Eastspring Investments Global Emerging Markets ex-China Dynamic
fund, who said the value opportunity of other EM regions is being ignored due to China's dominance.
Hingorani said ex-China markets have experienced a near capitulation in outflows, which presents an opportunity.
'Looking at the data on flows since 2017, we have seen more than EUR90bn worth of outflows from ex-China. So with respect to investor positioning, and with respect to flows, there's been almost a capitulation. And then in terms of valuation, we also see that it's trading at a 40% discount to developed markets. So there's a valuation opportunity, which we think is strong.'
Historically, when any single market comes to dominate an index, investors tend to make discrete allocations to that market, which then supports the growing popularity of other indices, said Hingorani.
A prime example is the US within the MSCI World index, he added.
'When the US became so dominant, investors began to make separate allocations which supported indices such as the MSCI World ex-US.'
Twenty years ago, emerging markets were more diverse, with no single country dominating the index, Hingorani told Citywire Selector. Now, China is by far the most dominant, accounting for around 33% of the MSCI EM index - more than twice the weight of the next largest country. A percentage which he added could potentially grow to 50%.
'This creates a scenario where you have one out of 24 countries dominating and opportunities being marginalised, and investors missing out on what we feel is a strong value opportunity.'
Therefore, having an ex-China portfolio makes other regions more relevant within the index, he said.
'If a country has 50 stocks in the MSCI EM index, which is a universe with around 1,400 stocks, that country is relatively marginalised. You take that same country with the 50 stocks, and you put it into an ex-China portfolio, with around 650 stocks, it becomes a lot more relevant and meaningful.'
Investing approach and picks
Launched in 2021, Hingorani's EUR32m fund lost 7.2% in the year to January 2023, compared with a sector average return of -13.1%. Samsung Electronics is the portfolio's top holding, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Hon Hai Precision Industry, Naspers and ICICI Bank.
Hingorani and his team follow a value-based philosophy, typically picking unloved stocks, he said.
'We believe the reason value works is due to behavioural biases, the two most simple being fear and greed. When a company does well, investors like to extrapolate that into the future, thinking that growth is going to continue strongly. And we've seen numerous instances where companies aren't able to deliver that into perpetuity.
'Similarly, that then leads itself to opportunities where a company disappoints and creates a pricing opportunity.'
According to Morningstar data, the fund is currently overweight in the financial sector, which Hingorani said is in a position to benefit from the new environment of high inflation and rates.
Unlike developed markets, EMs have been dealing with inflation for more than a decade so this is not a new phenomenon for these economies.
'Additionally, we are in an environment where there are some positive real rates in many emerging markets, versus negative real rates in developed markets,' Hingorani said.",https://citywireselector.com/news/em-investors-ignoring-alpha-potential-of-ex-china-strategies/a2409879,2
2023-02-21,a2409856,AllianzGI to evaluate executive pay against wider workforce,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,Allianz Global Investors will vote against 'overly generous' pay packages if companies haven't done enough to protect their staff.,"Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) is the latest asset manager to announce it will vote against executive pay packages if the company hasn't done enough to protect its employees.
In a press statement, AllianzGI said current economic conditions and high inflation rates mean the asset manager will 'carefully evaluate generous pay packages taking into account how they relate to pay increases of the wider workforce and consider whether companies underwent significant layoffs, restructuring or cut dividends'.
A similar stance has been taken by Aviva Investors, which earlier this February announced that the cost-of-living crisis will be a top engagement priority during this year's proxy season as 'it would be inappropriate for highly paid executives to be fully insulated from the impacts of inflation'.
AllianzGI stewardship analyst Kimon Demetriades said the firm will generally vote against the board if pay packages are 'overly generous'. It will also hold directors accountable if the company does not have credible net-zero emissions targets in place.
Increasing scrutiny on pay
During last year's proxy season, new EU regulation meant companies in several markets had to put remuneration reports to a shareholder vote for the first time.
AllianzGI voted against 43% of remuneration-related proposals globally and was particularly critical of the executive payouts at US companies, where it voted against 77.8% of such proposals compared with just 28% in the UK.
'We often had concerns on transparency, in particular when it came to clearly disclosing the link between performance and payout, as well as discretionary pay components that were not backed by performance as well as high pension payments,' said Demetriades.
'As of 2023, we further strengthen our voting guidelines with respect to sustainability aspects: we expect European large-cap companies to include environmental, social and governance key performance indicators into their remuneration and would vote against pay policies if this is not implemented.
'We already had a number of conversations on the topic in 2022 with companies where we felt there was a gap,' he said.
Matt Christensen, global head of sustainable and impact investing at AllianzGI, signalled that greater accountability on climate transition targets and continued scrutiny of remuneration will be two of the firm's main focuses.
AllianzGI said that 'certain high-emitting companies' with 'dissatisfactory' net-zero ambitions or climate-related financial disclosures will face additional pressure from AllianzGI next year when the asset manager will vote against the chairperson of the sustainability committee, the strategy committee or the chairperson of the board.
Demetriades said AllianzGI is also ready to vote alongside independent shareholders including NGOs 'if this helps the cause'.

The boss of the $7.2tn asset manager told the Financial Times the reasons behind the firm's decision to withdraw from the collective movement in December of last year.
Buckley said the group felt the scale of the industry-wide alliance, which involves 301 asset management stakeholders, meant Vanguard was at risk of having its 'voice drowned out or confused'.
However, Buckley stressed the US-headquartered group remained committed to climate abatement efforts and would continue to focus on company disclosure standards.
'It would be hubris to presume that we know the right strategy for the thousands of companies that Vanguard invests with. We just want to make sure that risks are being appropriately disclosed and that every company is playing by the rules,' he told the FT.

The most senior position at the Paris-based group has always been held by a founding partner, but that will change with the appointment of Denis Panel, who was most recently with BNP Paribas Asset Management.
Panel was an investment director at BNP within its multi-asset, quantitative and solutions division, known as MAQS. He spent 15 years with the French group, having previously worked as a fixed income fund manager at Societe Generale AM and then as global head of diversified management at Credit Agricole AM.
As a shareholder in Sycomore AM, the outgoing chief, Preaubert, will continue to work on the supervisory committee where he will play an advisory role in the development of the management company.
Meanwhile, Christine Kolb and Cyril Charlot, fellow co-founders of Sycomore AM, will retain their responsibilities and functions and will support Panel in his new role. Panel will assume the position on 3 April 2023.
Sycomore AM said the appointment of Panel will build on its reputation in sustainable and responsible investing, and help to accelerate its international growth.

2023-02-21,a2409774,Pimco's Ivascyn backs 'pretty darn attractive' private markets,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,Group CIO says public markets move faster but he is again looking to alternative ideas to help fuel long-term returns.,"Pimco's Dan Ivascyn is once again making the case for fixed income investors to make more of a push into private markets, even as the traditional areas of investing begin to offer up a welcome level of yield.
In an investment committee outlook, the US bond house's group chief investment officer said private markets had not experienced the same level of repricing as publicly listed companies, but this doesn't undermine the case for properly assessing your allocations.
'Public markets always tend to move first, and because we had such a massive move in rates and in equity markets, they moved a lot,' Ivascyn wrote in a Q&A.
'Private markets tend to be slow to move, and because of the big move in public markets, that gap is about as wide as we've seen throughout our career. That gap will converge over time. It could converge by private marks catching up to their public counterparts. It could converge by public markets rallying back to the private levels. Or more likely, a little bit of both.'
Ivascyn pointed to the 'lagging' nature of private markets, which meant near-term investment ideas are likely to favour public markets, given the level of yields now on offer.
'That being said, we think there are going to be tremendous opportunities within the private opportunity set, particularly for patient investors. There's been such a violent move in yields, in spreads, in public equity markets, in various areas of the private equity markets, VC, growth equity, that it's going to lead to strain and stress that's going to develop over time.'
Looking ahead, Ivascyn said the requirements around new capital may not be adequately covered by public markets alone. This would further boost the case for private markets, especially when over-levered companies may need to rebalance their books as rates rise and inflation bites.
'So even though the opportunity is significantly tilted in favour of public markets today, investors should really think about setting up for what's going to be a pretty darn attractive opportunity, and we think there's a chance that that opportunity could last for several years.'
Market commentaries from Ivascyn have often been peppered with allusions to opportunities in private markets. In November 2021, he said the sector offered a good counterweight to the under-pressure credit markets, while last summer he said patient investors could benefit from parking longer-term allocations in these areas.",https://citywireselector.com/news/pimco-s-ivascyn-backs-pretty-darn-attractive-private-markets/a2409774,3

2023-02-22,a2410023,Amedeo Air Four to yield 20% after dividend hike and capital return,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Gavin Lumsden,Shares in the plane-leasing fund fly 12% higher after the reopening of China and pressure from investors sees PS28m returned to shareholders and dividends increased by 17%.,"Shares in Amedeo Air Four Plus (AA4 ) climbed 12% higher to a 29-month peak today after the high-yielding but debt-laden plane-leasing fund announced it would return PS28m to shareholders and hike quarterly dividends by 17%.
Robin Hallam, chair of the Guernsey investment company that owns a dozen jumbo jets leased to the Emirates and Thai airlines and carries $1.2bn in debt, said the return of capital via a compulsory purchase of one in eight of the ordinary shares, plus the increase in the dividend from 1.5p to 1.75p per share, was in direct response to the reopening of China's economy.
'The big news is the reopening of China,' he told investors. 'This is significant for two reasons. First, its closure was one of the main reasons for international travel remaining stubbornly at around 75% of pre-pandemic levels.
'Second, and of more direct relevance to us, Chinese tourism is a big element of Thai Airways traffic and is vital if they are to remain a profitable airline.'
From a pandemic low of 23p, shares in Amedeo soared 56% last year as international travel resumed after worldwide lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus were relaxed.
Before today, the stock had advanced a further 19% this year, boosted by Thai Airways emerging from bankruptcy proceedings and reverting to paying its full monthly rent on the four wide-body Airbus A350s it leases from the closed-end fund. During the downturn, it had paid Amedeo by the hour for the use of the planes to save money.
The emergence of activist investors such as Metage Capital, Weiss, and Elliott last year, who own more than 18% of the shares, is also likely to have been behind today's good news.
The 5.25p spike in the shares to 48.5p still leaves Amedeo a long way off its 2019 peak of 159p, and on a massive 63% discount to analysts' estimate of net asset value per share of 116.3p. That reduces its market value to PS150m, despite holding assets worth PS404m net of debt.
Nevertheless, the gain reflected investor pleasure at the 64.5p that Amedeo, a self-managed fund since parting company with manager Nimrod two years ago, was paying to redeem the shares.
'Put another way, the return of capital is worth 8.06p per share, or 18.6% of the current price,' said Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum, the company's corporate broker.
Khoo said the new annualised dividend of 7p per share implied a dividend yield of 16%, up from the current 14%, with the payments underpinned by the income paid by the Emirates on the six Airbus A380s and two Boeing 777s leased from Amedeo. Before Covid-19 saw payouts interrupted and fall, Amedeo paid out just over 8p per share a year.
Setting a share price target of 50p, Khoo noted what the board called its 'prudent approach' to liquidity and cash resources. 'We believe this implies increased confidence in the likelihood of Emirates and Thai Airways honouring their lease payments in full, and there being sufficient retained cash and aircraft residual value to cover debt repayments,' the analyst said.
Stifel analyst Sachin Saggar, who had previously questioned the eight-year-old company's ability to repay $35m-$40m of debt payments when each plane lease expires from 2026 onwards, was also impressed with the 'very positive update'.
He predicted the dividend yield would rise close to 20% after the capital return on 1 March.
He added: 'Our one gripe would be that the board should now consider providing greater transparency on some of their underlying assumptions so investors can better understand how much cash is being conserved to meet debt balloon payments.'

Kumar will oversee the fund alongside Veronica Perez-Campanero Antolin, who joined Artemis last year from Capital Group, where she worked as an equities analyst, specialising in European small and mid-caps.
Kumar also currently manages the PS232m Artemis Strategic Assets fund and co-manages the PS123m Artemis Alpha (ATS ) investment trust. He joined Artemis in 2012 as a graduate trainee.
Millet had worked as a fund manager at Artemis since 2010, prior to which he was a fund manager at LV.
Artemis chief investment officer Paras Anand said: 'Europe has an abundance of world-class companies in all sizes. There are many exciting, undervalued businesses and lots of opportunities for smart stockpickers to deliver strong returns.
'Kartik and Veronica are talented managers who have a strong focus on valuation. The fund is in great hands.'
The European Sustainable Growth strategy was named in Bestinvest's Spot the Dog list of repeat poor performers last August. In the three years to the end of January, the fund returned 12.7%, underperforming the sector average of 24.3%.
Kumar's appointment follows a raft of internal promotions as Artemis seeks to further its new generation of talent.
Two analysts were promoted to managers in September 2022. Olivia Micklem was appointed co-manager of the PS994.2m Artemis US Smaller Companies
fund, alongside Cormac Weldon.
Micklem had worked as an analyst at Artemis for almost nine years, specialising in US equities. She joined the company from Threadneedle Investments, where she worked for nearly seven years, most recently as an analyst.
Chris Kent was promoted to co-manager of the PS1.8bn Artemis US Select
fund, also working with Weldon.
Kent worked as a US equity analyst alongside Micklem for almost nine years, having also joined the firm from Threadneedle Investments.
Artemis made many changes to its manager lineup last year, with managers David Ennett and Jack Holmes taking over the PS661m Artemis Monthly Distribution
fund following the departure of AA-rated Stephen Baines.
Artemis co-founder and Citywire + rated Derek Stuart is due to step back from running the PS499m Artemis UK Special Situations fund at the end of this year.
In readiness for his departure, Henry Flockhart joined Citywire + rated Andy Gray last July from Aviva Investors, where he managed the firm's PS214.5 UK Equity Unconstrained fund.

News yesterday that the S&P Global PMI index returned to expansion for the first time in eight months - with a 50.2 reading in February from 46.8 in January - saw the FTSE extend its decline to close 0.5% lower on Tuesday.
Wall Street went on to tumble 2% as expectations for US interest rates to be cut evaporated with predictions for the Federal Reserve's funds rate to hit 5.4% this summer. The US stock market recorded its worst day this year, sparking a selloff in Asia that knocked the UK blue-chip benchmark a further 0.9%, or 70 points, to 7,908 this morning.
Hargreaves Lansdown's head of markets Susannah Streeter said the 'wave of exuberance' has turned to 'tides of disappointment and apprehension about the difficulties that may still lie ahead for the mighty US economy'.
'High hopes that the Fed could cut rates by the end of the year have been dashed, replaced by worries that up to three hikes in quick succession may be needed to tame the price spiral,' she said.
The pound slipped 0.2% against the dollar at around $1.21, while yields on gilts, or UK government bonds, rose as their prices fell.
Commodity and mining stocks again weighed on the leading UK index after Rio Tinto's (RIO) results revealed the extent to which China's lockdowns scuppered iron ore demand.
The miner fell 1.6%, or 97p, to PS61.07 after reporting a 37.9% drop in annual profit and halving its dividend, just a day after Antofagasta (ANTO) slashed its dividend by 60%. Its shares gave up 1.8%, or 31p, at PS16.91.
Glencore (GLEN) shed 2.3%, or 11p, to 491p, followed by Endeavour Mining (ENDV), down 2.2% at PS17.36. BP (BP) retreated 1.6% to 541p.
Lloyds (LLOY) slipped 1.9%, or 0.9p, to 49p, despite the bank announcing a PS2bn share buyback. Investors were instead focused on the flat profits - with a 1% fall in annual underlying profit to PS7.4bn caused by a rising bad debt book. HSBC (HSBA), which reported a doubling of quarterly profits but a fall in full-year profits yesterday, eased 1.6% to 636p.
The FTSE 250 was just as downbeat as its large-cap peer, falling 0.9%, or 186p, to 19,664. Georgian bank TBC (TBC) slid 6.9%, or 175p, to PS23.45 after reporting a 24% jump in full-year profits.
It was followed by engineering group John Wood (WG), which shed 3.3% to 146p, and clean energy group Drax (DRX), which lost 3.1% to 649p despite signing new agreements to provide energy from its hydro assets.",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/ftse-falls-as-surprise-us-business-recovery-reignites-rate-fears/a2409973,10
2023-02-22,a2409969,Efama takes aim at 'unclear' ESG fund name thresholds,Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,The asset management association calls for a delay to proposed guidelines for sustainability-related fund names due to a lack of clarity on sustainable investment.,"The European Fund and Asset Management Association (Efama) has said that the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) should delay its proposed guidelines on ESG fund names.
Esma published a consultation paper on guidelines on fund names incorporating ESG- or sustainability-related terms in November of last year, to ensure fund names accurately reflect their investment objectives and strategies.
Among other things, Esma proposed that funds using ESG-related terms should allocate at least 80% of investments to meet environmental or social characteristics or sustainable investment objectives as per Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulations (SFDR).
Additionally, funds with sustainability-related names should allocate at least 50% within that 80% to sustainable investments as defined under the SFDR.
In its response to the consultation, Efama said its members are concerned about the numerical threshold approach, arguing that it may not address underlying green-washing issues in the industry due to 'a lack of clarity on key sustainable finance concepts'.
Similar criticisms have been made against SFDR level 2, under which Article 9 funds must invest 100% of their assets in sustainable investments.
Several asset managers chose to downgrade their Article 9 funds shortly before the regulation came in place, stating the absence of a definition for what constitutes a sustainable investment under SFDR makes it impossible to claim to live up to the dark green label.
In a press release, the industry association said Esma should delay the guidelines until it has 'rectified' the 'lack of clarity on what constitutes a sustainable investment'.
Efama also said Esma should work with the European Commission to 'resolve interoperability issues' between the guidelines and SFDR, Mifid and similar regulations.
Should Esma go ahead with the numerical threshold, Efama said several other elements still need to be addressed.
The asset manager association wants cash, cash equivalents and derivatives used for hedging to be excluded from the 80% threshold to 'allow for efficient fund management, especially during extraordinary market circumstances'.
It also questioned the 'appropriateness' of a separate threshold of 50% for funds with sustainability-related names, given the lack of clarity on the term 'sustainable investment'.
Anyve Arakelijan, a regulatory policy adviser at Efama, said: 'It is unlikely that a methodology built on an unclear legal definition will increase investor understanding of ESG funds and adequately address green-washing concerns.
'Rather than imposing a threshold, it would be more proportionate to mirror Esma's supervisory guidance on sustainability risks and disclosures by ensuring that the use of ESG-related terms is supported in a material way, with sufficient evidence of sustainability characteristics in the fund's investment objectives and strategy,' she argued.",https://citywireselector.com/news/efama-takes-aim-at-unclear-esg-fund-name-thresholds/a2409969,0
2023-02-22,a2409881,"It's time to revisit EM corporate bonds, says Fisch AM's Rutz",Not a displacement opportunity,Not a displacement opportunity,CityWire,Siri Christiansen,"Better-than-expected macroeconomics and China's reopening have created strong entry opportunities in EM corporate bonds, says outperforming portfolio manager.","EM corporate bonds have bounced back since their end-of-October lows but remain underweight in many portfolios.
However, a faster-than-expected drop in inflation, coupled with China's reopening and a soft landing in the US, mean the asset class currently offers strong entry opportunities, high carry and strong fundamentals.
That's according to Citywire + rated Thomas Fischli Rutz, head of emerging markets at Fisch Asset Management, who said many investors' worst-case scenarios have not materialised.
'Soft landings are rare, but they do happen. In our baseline scenario, we expect a flat, brief recession in the US and a recovery in economic growth over the course of the year,' Rutz said in a market commentary.
'On the economic front, we are seeing inflation come down faster than expected - with a weaker US dollar also helping on this score. At the same time, monetary policy - at least in the US and Europe - is still very strict and is likely to lead to a further slowdown in the economy.
'As for emerging markets, interest rates appear to have already peaked given that these countries started hiking much sooner. In addition, China's exit from its zero-Covid policy is likely to fuel economic growth and further help to widen the gap between emerging market and developed market growth,' said Rutz.
IMF raises growth forecast
Rutz highlighted that the International Monetary Fund has upgraded its GDP growth forecast for emerging markets to 4.0% in 2023 and 4.2% in 2024.
The strong fundamental position of emerging market issuers is also evident in default rates, Rutz said. He expects them to move lower than initially anticipated and drop to single digits following the recovery of China's real estate market.
'China's surprisingly sudden and complete exit from its extremely restrictive Covid policy has distinctly improved investor sentiment towards emerging markets, as is apparent from the record-high inflows of about $8bn into the asset class since the beginning of the year,' Rutz said.
Fisch AM's portfolios are currently targeting carry opportunities and higher credit quality securities in the BBB- and BB-rated range. Rutz said 'broad diversification and careful security selection are advisable to minimise risk', but also pointed to high yield bonds as an 'effective performance cushion'.
'Since markets will remain data-dependent for some time, this positioning enables us to weather any potential volatility without a major deterioration in credit quality as well as potentially taking advantage of market upheaval when it becomes apparent.
'At the country level, we continue to favour Mexico given that its geographical proximity to the US enables it to benefit from the current nearshoring trend. We are also focused on companies in the commodities sector, including oil and gold producers, which are the beneficiaries of the recovery of demand in China,' said Rutz.",https://citywireselector.com/news/it-s-time-to-revisit-em-corporate-bonds-says-fisch-am-s-rutz/a2409881,1

Both products have an expense ratio of 0.5%. The protection levels are defined and will not change, but the cap on upside will vary each month depending on the protection and call costs.
Rob Oliver, head of business development for Global X ETFs in Europe, said the funds could be particularly appealing for investors looking to reposition their portfolios at this time.
'With the macro environment and inflationary pressures you see across the globe, and also the risk of recession and potential downturn in equity markets, investors in Europe are looking for protection or vehicles that can provide protection,' Oliver told Citywire.
'We were looking at potential solutions that offer protection but also allow you to participate in the upside in the equity market. The way these products work is they have different defined buffers and then we sell a cap to offset that protection.'

'If you think around how European investors invest, most people benchmark to the MSCI World or MSCI ACWI,' he explained.

Fabreges joined the German rival this month as director of senior portfolio managers, after eight years at DWS. His latest role at the firm was senior portfolio manager within the multi-asset department.
The Invest Global Bonds fund, which has EUR109m in assets, is now overseen by Lukas Herrmann and Carsten Weins.
This strategy currently sits mid-table in the Bonds - Global sector, having lost 12.5% over the past three years, against a -8.3% sector average return. Over the past year, the fund fell 10.7%, compared to a sector average return of -9%.
'While Herrmann represents the expertise of the euro unconstrained fixed income strategies, Weins contributes his experience from global fixed income strategies,' a spokesperson for DWS said.

2023-02-23,a2410113,Equity fund flows hit one-year high after 'forgettable' 2022,Drop in AUM,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,Morningstar data indicates positive reversal as capital flows into strategies over the first month of this year.,"Both equity and fixed income funds have found favour among investors, with capital allocators making the most of attractive valuations to pour EUR54.1bn into long-term, Europe-domiciled strategies over the first month of 2023.
These levels reverse a challenging period for traditional asset classes, which research giant Morningstar said had experienced a 'forgettable' year as part of its publication of the latest findings.
Among other headlines, equity funds hit inflow levels not seen since exactly a year ago, as EUR25.3bn was invested, with global large-cap blend and global emerging market equity funds proving the most popular. Meanwhile, UK-focused and European large-cap equities suffered due to perceived uncertainty over the regions' policy outlooks.
Bond funds hit levels not seen since the summer of 2021, with EUR33.7bn of inflows recorded for January. Euro-denominated corporate bond funds, as well as global emerging markets and euro-denominated sovereign bond strategies performed well.
Morningstar said this level of positivity was noteworthy, as bond markets have borne the brunt of changing rates and creeping inflation, as well as sitting squarely in the crosshairs of central bankers seeking to get on top of their economic growth.
Elsewhere, allocation strategies - most commonly mixed-asset funds - experienced a sixth consecutive month of outflows, as EUR2.9bn was withdrawn. Commodities funds shed EUR689m, largely attributed to a huge pullback from the precious metals markets.
Passive v active
Breaking down active/passive mix, passive funds attracted a slightly higher level of inflows than their active peers, with EUR28.2bn invested, as opposed to EUR25.8bn. Long-term index funds now account for 24.2% of the European funds market, an increase from 22.3% one year ago.
Sustainability-focused funds had their best period of inflows since December 2021, as EUR24bn was allocated to Article 8 strategies and EUR2.6bn went into Article 9-compliant funds.
Morningstar noted these inflows came at a time when many fund houses have realigned or downgraded funds' levels of Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) compliance ahead of SFDR Level 2 coming into full effect. In October 2022, Morningstar counted 1,058 funds listed as Article 9, which had shrunk to 862 by January 2023.
Going to a granular fund level, there was a surprise winner in one-month flows. Spanish group CaixaBank launched the target-dated CaixaBank Deuda Publica 2024 FI fund in January 2023, with a focus on short-term Italian and Spanish debt.
This fund attracted EUR2.06bn in assets over the month, compared with EUR1.19bn going into bond fund giant Pimco's GIS Income
fund over the same period.
At the other end of the spectrum, UBS Asset Management's Focused High Grade Long Term Bond USD
fund shed EUR945m over the course of the month, but still has EUR3.1bn in net assets.",https://citywireselector.com/news/equity-fund-flows-hit-one-year-high-after-forgettable-2022/a2410113,2

2023-02-23,a2410152,BNP Paribas hit with 'world's first climate lawsuit',Negative press,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Ariane Khosrovchahi,"Friends of the Earth France, Notre Affaire a Tous, and Oxfam France are suing the French bank in the Paris judicial court.","Three French non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are launching what they are calling 'the world's first climate lawsuit against a commercial bank'.
Four months ago, Friends of the Earth France, Notre Affaire a Tous, and Oxfam France gave notice to BNP Paribas to stop supporting the development of fossil fuels and comply with its legal obligations under the French corporate duty of care law.
Today, the NGOs took the bank to court 'for its enormous support of fossil fuels and its substantial contribution to climate change'.
In a press release, the NGOs claimed BNP Paribas had not responded to the formal demands made on 26 October 2022. As a result, they have lodged a complaint against the bank in the Paris judicial court.
BNP Paribas told Citywire it regretted that the NGOs were 'taking the route of litigation rather than that of dialogue'. The bank said it was convinced that the green transition was the only viable option for the future of the global economy.
'We are focused on our path of phasing out fossil fuels, increasing the financing of renewable energy projects and supporting our customers, without whom the transition cannot take place,' it said.
Duty of care
But how did we get here?
'A summons has been issued because BNP Paribas does not respect the French law on the duty of care and refuses to stop financing the expansion of fossil fuel companies, which is an urgent appeal from the scientific community,' the NGOs said.
Since 2017, the French duty of care law has required large companies to make considerable efforts in preventing human rights abuses and environmental damage throughout their operations.
The bank voiced its disagreement with the NGOs in a letter seen by Agence France-Presse on 26 January in response to the formal notice. The bank said organisations 'cannot replace legislators' and that it 'deeply disagreed' with the NGOs' interpretation of the duty of care law.
No end in sight for fossil fuels
According to the NGOs, BNP Paribas is the world's leading financier of eight European and North American oil and gas companies, which are involved in more than 200 new fossil fuel projects around the world.
In response, the bank said: 'BNP Paribas is, like other major international banks, a historical financier of energy production. About 10 years ago, 95% of our energy investments were in fossil fuel projects. Today, more than half of our investments in energy are in low-carbon energy. By 2030, BNP Paribas will have completed more than 80% of its transition to low-carbon energy production, well ahead of the rest of the economy.'
Today, the NGOs called for the bank to stop financing fossil fuel expansion immediately and form an exit plan from oil and gas. They said: 'A month ago, BNP Paribas committed to reducing its outstanding investments in oil and gas extraction and production by 2030. However, neither these public promises nor the official response given by the bank to the lawyers representing the three organisations is enough.'
They said the bank still allows its investee companies to develop new fossil fuel projects without committing to a phased exit from the sector.
Alexandre Poidatz, Oxfam France's finance and climate change spokesperson, said that instead of making 'concrete promises to respond to fundamental scientific truths, BNP Paribas is polishing its image and trying to sow doubt in people's minds about the accuracy of these scientific statements'. He believes the legal action will force the bank to keep its promises.
Justine Ripoll, a campaign manager at Notre Affaire a Tous, said: 'This climate dispute against a commercial bank will undoubtedly be the first of a long series around the world.'",https://citywire.com/funds-insider/bnp-paribas-hit-with-world-s-first-climate-lawsuit/a2410152,0

Ramaswamy, 37, confirmed that he will be running for president earlier this week.
He is pursuing the Republican nomination against former president Donald Trump and former governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley. Florida's governor Ron DeSantis has also been tipped to enter the race but has not yet confirmed his candidacy.
After Politico first reported that Ramaswamy was considering running, the Strive founder confirmed his intentions on Fox News this week. He also tweeted:
America's strength is not our diversity but the ideals that unify us across our differences. Merit. Free speech. Truth. Accountability. I believe deep in my bones these ideals still exist, and I am running for President to revive them.https://t.co/LcDB04ihNQ pic.twitter.com/ijVRyawQPZ
-- Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) February 22, 2023
As a result, Ramaswamy will be stepping down from his role at Strive, the asset management firm he launched last year.
Strive's other founder and president Anson Frericks will assume Ramaswamy's position on the board of directors.
'Vivek is stepping away from Strive to solve a lot of the political issues that are better left to the ballot box [and] that's going to open up additional opportunities for a lot of people at Strive to be able to comment on how we're building the organisation, carrying out our mission and hopefully continuing to impact corporate America in a positive way,' Frericks told Citywire.
'Over the past year, I focused on building the team and building the organisation while Vivek focused on thought leadership but I will now focus on more of the thought leadership since we have the base of the company put in place.'
The firm will now be led by Frericks, chief operating officer Ben Pham, chief investment officer Matt Cole and head of corporate governance Justin Danhof.
Ramaswamy's background is in biotech, and in 2021, he wrote the book Woke Inc: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.
He launched Strive last year with backing from billionaire Peter Thiel, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, and a handful of other wealthy individuals.
Strive's mission has been to act as an anti-ESG activist, pushing companies including ExxonMobil, Disney and Apple to focus less on social issues such as diversity or climate change and more on maximizing shareholder returns.",https://citywireselector.com/news/strive-ceo-steps-down-from-anti-esg-shop-to-focus-on-white-house-run/a2410196,4
2023-02-27,a2410448,Vanguard given 'E' in ESG report card as AM giants fare poorly,Negative press,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Nicola Blackburn,A report by responsible investment campaign group ShareAction has found Vanguard to be a 'worst in class' asset manager for tackling climate issues.,"Vanguard and Franklin Templeton were among the worst asset managers for responsible investment policies, according to a report ranking the world's largest asset managers on ESG action.
The report, produced by responsible investment campaign group ShareAction, graded the world's 77 largest asset managers between A and E for their commitment to five responsible investment themes: governance, stewardship, climate, biodiversity and social issues.
In the 2023 report, Vanguard was assigned an E rating and was ranked 67th of the 77 managers for its overall responsible investment approach.
Vanguard was one of many asset managers to receive low scores for their passive and index strategies. US managers BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors both received a D.
Franklin Templeton came in at 66th, just ahead of China Asset Management in 70th.
According to the report, Vanguard's commitment was most lacking in areas of climate and biodiversity preservation, but it showed more commitment towards governance and stewardship causes.
We've been here before
This is not the first time Vanguard has received a low ranking for its responsible investment approach. It was given an E in ShareAction's 2020 report.
Earlier this month, Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley was forced to defend its exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, a group of international asset managers committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Climate protestors have also targeted Vanguard for its investment in fossil fuel companies and projects.
But the asset manager has taken steps to expand its ESG footprint in recent years, appointing a head of ESG strategy for Europe and launching several sustainability-focused funds.
This includes an actively managed version of its popular LifeStrategy range, which has attracted more than PS600m since its launch in November 2021.
In a statement to Citywire New Model Adviser, Vanguard said it offered strategies to suit a range of sustainable investment preferences.
'We evaluate the implications of financially material risks, including environmental and social risks, on long-term portfolio performance,' the statement said.
'For those investors who want to invest in line with their ESG preferences, we offer ESG index and active funds with different ESG strategies. Across our broader fund line-up, our active fund investment managers work to integrate material ESG considerations into their investment process alongside other financially material considerations. We also engage with portfolio companies.'",https://citywireselector.com/news/vanguard-given-e-in-esg-report-card-as-am-giants-fare-poorly/a2410448,3

Artemis has appointed Alex Stanic to the newly created position of head of global equities. He joins from JP Morgan Asset Management after seven years there.
The departing duo manage the PS459m (EUR521m) Mid Wynd International
investment trust and the PS396m (EUR449m) Artemis Global Select
fund.
Stanic will take over Illingworth's responsibilities from the start of March, co-managing the portfolios with Edelsten until his retirement.
At JP Morgan, Stanic managed its Global Unconstrained Equity
fund. Before that, he was head of River and Mercantile's global equities division, which he set up in 2009.
Artemis chief investment officer Paras Anand said: 'Simon Edelsten and Alex Illingworth are widely and rightly respected for the job they have done in the past 12 years at Artemis.
'They have delivered outstanding long-term returns for client portfolios and grown the size of the Mid Wynd and the Artemis Global Select funds substantially.'

2023-02-28,a2410482,Swiss regulator finds serious breaches at Credit Suisse over Greensill,Negative press,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Fergus Horsfall,"The regulator welcomed changes already made by the Swiss group, but is still ordering additional measures.","Finma has concluded its enforcement proceedings against Credit Suisse in connection to financier Lex Greensill and his companies, finding a serious breach of Swiss supervisory law.
The Swiss regulator said Credit Suisse seriously breached its supervisory obligations with regard to risk management and appropriate organisational structures, falling short in its supervisory duties as an asset manager.
Finma has ordered a series of remedial measures, compliance with which will be reviewed by an audit mandatary. The bank will have to periodically review its near-500 most important business relationships at executive board level, especially for counterparty risks.
In addition, the responsibilities of its near-600 highest-ranking employees must be recorded in a responsibility document. The bank must sanction them if they do not organise their business area in a manner which prevents misconduct as far as possible, for example by reducing variable compensation.
The regulator has also opened four enforcement proceedings against former Credit Suisse managers. It is not sharing their identities or other additional details.
In March 2021, Credit Suisse closed four supply chain finance funds related to Greensill companies at short notice. The funds, which had a low-risk level indicated in their documentation, had $10bn in assets. To date, $7.4bn worth of cash has been collected from them, and two of them are fully liquidated.
Credit Suisse said it welcomed the conclusion of proceedings at Finma, and noted it has already made personnel changes and updated risk management procedures. Finma supports this, but is also ordering additional measures.
Risk development
Finma's investigation showed that Credit Suisse's asset management company did not have much knowledge of the specific claims which were securitised in its funds. Greensill selected, reviewed the claims and arranged insurance for them.
'Over time, the risk character of the funds changed decisively,' Finma said. Greensill began selling future claims to the funds that had not yet arisen, consequently financing companies with dubious creditworthiness. Credit Suisse did not initially realise the consequences of this, and did not know or control how many claims were contractually owed, relying on Greensill's insurance cover.
Another fund provider which had worked with Greensill closed a fund, leading to enquiries at Credit Suisse in 2018, Finma said, without specifying who the fund provider in question was.
In the same year, rival asset manager GAM fired star bond manager Tim Haywood in 2018, after he reportedly invested client money into assets sourced by Greensill.
Against a backdrop of Finma and the media asking critical questions about Credit Suisse's business relationship with Greensill, Greensill announced to Credit Suisse that it was planning an IPO, but first needed a bridging loan.
Management oversight
The Credit Suisse risk manager responsible for the loan recommended the request should be denied, having identified risks in Greensill's business model. However, a senior manager overruled the recommendation.
In addition, the bank used staff who were responsible for the business relationship with Greensill to deal with warnings, despite their lack of independence.
Credit Suisse also relied on Lex Greensill's own answers for its statements and consequently made partly false and overly positive statements to Finma.
The business relationship with Greensill was repeatedly discussed by Credit Suisse management, but this usually only happened in relation to a specific event or request.
The regulator's requirement for Credit Suisse to review its most important business relationships comes in response to this lack of consistent engagement with risks at the highest level.",https://citywireselector.com/news/swiss-regulator-finds-serious-breaches-at-credit-suisse-over-greensill/a2410482,1
2023-03-03,a2410631,What we learned from looking at a year's worth of manager moves,Portfolio manager change,Displacement opportunity,CityWire,Chris Sloley,"Focusing on our monthly 'most popular' countdown, Citywire Selector uncovers the most prominent sectors and players.","Fund manager moves are a fundamental part of Citywire Selector's coverage.
Beyond the gossip and simple human interest of someone switching jobs - it is important for fund selectors to know who is overseeing the strategy they are either investing in or recommending to clients.
But, what trends and common occurrences might be going under the radar? In a bid to make a manageable data set from which to draw conclusions, we have focused on the monthly Fund Manager Moves gallery, which showcases the 10 most popular stories relating to a manager move.
Between February 2022 and February 2023, there are 120 changes that effectively caught readers' attention. For the sake of this quasi-scientific analysis, internal promotions and changes, as well as more business-orientated moves (where a portfolio manager becomes a CEO, for example), have been left to one side.
Instead, this focuses on individual hires, changes and retirements by active fund managers, most prominently moving between different asset managers. This leaves us with a core data set 70 moves which fit these criteria.
Hot sectors
Perhaps not a surprise to close market followers, changes within thematic equities proved hugely popular. This kicked into gear in early 2022 when Allianz Global Investors' veteran technology duo Walter Price and Huachen Chen announced plans to retire.
This necessitated the Frankfurt-headquartered fund house bringing in Erik Swords from Newton Investment Management, who formally joined in June of the same year to lead the tech efforts. AllianzGI also hired another Newton manager in the shape of Justin Sumner to assist.
This wasn't the only thematic-facing hire for AllianzGI over the past year, as Alex Bibani was added from UK investment group Sarasin & Partners to lead AllianzGI's Positive Change
fund. Joining in the summer of 2022, Bibani was recruited as part of plans to accelerate growth of both its sustainability and wider thematic range.
Thematics also proved popular at M&G Investments, which made an aggressive push with the appointment of Jeffrey Lin and Thomas Lee from TCW Group. The pair, who had run the Los Angeles-based asset manager's AI and robotics-based funds, were brought on board in January of this year to help spearhead M&G's thematic offering.
Elsewhere, boutiques were also active in this field. Swiss group Decalia followed up on a previous raid of Belgian group Degroof Petercam, which saw it add two senior managers in September 2021, with another coup, which saw Jonathan Graas join in October 2022. Graas was hired to co-run its Circular Economy
fund.
Also making moves was tech-focused independent player BlueBox Asset Management, which reunited Mark Dainty with former colleague William De Gale. Dainty, who had been most recently been at Norges Bank Investment Management but worked with De Gale at BlackRock, was hired to oversee a Precision Medicine fund, which was launched this week.
It wasn't just thematics that proved popular, however. An old favourite in the shape of emerging market debt also experienced a steady flow of manager moves over the past year. At a most senior level, Jennifer Taylor, Magda Branet and Sergio Trigo Paz were all recruited to lead EMD units at State Street Global Advisors, Axa Investment Managers and Union Bancaire Privee, respectively.
Elsewhere, Dmitry Griko and his entire team quit EG Capital Advisors and took their EM corporate bond fund to Arkaim Advisors, while Arnaud Boue moved within Switzerland - swapping Lombard Odier Investment Managers for Julius Baer and replacing outgoing Cesar Fernandez.
Elsewhere, experienced EM investor Joanne Baxter retired from her post at JPM Asset Management. Baxter relinquished $1bn worth of developing world debt funds, with Leandro Galli, who joined JPM AM from Amundi in January 2023, being installed as a co-manager on her former portfolios.
How not announce a fund manager move (Citywire Amplify)
Movers and shakers
Baxter and Galli weren't alone in switching around at JPM AM. Over the past 12 months, the group also saw Alex Stanic move to Artemis to lead its global equity operations, Benoit Lanctot depart after helping steer its Global Macro fund, while US mid-cap growth specialist Tim Parton announced plans to retire and EM veteran Richard Titherington took an extended leave of absence.
While many of these changes occurred for idiosyncratic reasons, Janus Henderson experienced several changes for more structural purposes. Newly appointed CEO Ali Dibadj hit the ground running with several consolidation efforts, which saw bond units brought together and other units streamlined.
Chief among those exiting was European equity investor Simon Rowe, market neutral manager Steven Johnstone and multi-asset specialist Dean Cheeseman.
Candriam, however, takes the crown for the busiest both in terms of ins and outs. On one side they hired sustainable bonds specialist Dany de Fonseca from Amundi, BNP Paribas AM multi-asset manager Sebastien Le Barre, market neutral duo Damien Vergnaud and Celia Fseil, as well as investment grade expert Yohanne Levy and Edmond de Rothschild's Marounae Bouchriha.
This is while several market neutral experts departed. Fabienne Cretin-Fumeron and Stephane Diedonne jumped to French group Carmignac, while Olivier Rose and Romain Vermont exited. Rose and Vermont joined Millennium in Paris as senior portfolio managers. The aforementioned Magda Branet also exited.
For full disclosure, however, the most common destination for a moving manager over this period was retirement. Nearly 16% of all relevant manager moves over this period. Prominent among them being value veteran Bill Miller, famed Japan equity investor Hideo Shiozumi and UBS Asset Management's Geoffrey Wong.",https://citywireselector.com/news/what-we-learned-from-looking-at-a-year-s-worth-of-manager-moves/a2410631,24

The fund initially targeted EUR120m of investments when it launched in September 2021 in scientific partnership with the French ocean research institute Ifremer, and has now reached EUR170m.
This makes it the largest venture capital fund in the world investing for the regeneration of ocean health, according to SWEN Capital Partners.
More than 85% of the backers are European or US institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign funds and family offices.
French investors including the insurance firms MACIF and MAIF, banking group Credit Mutuel Arkea and the French Public Investment Bank are among the recent investors in the strategy.
The fund invests in innovative companies, primarily startups, in areas such as sustainable aquaculture, ocean data, plant and cell-based seafood, single-use plastic alternatives, renewable marine energies, and the decarbonisation of maritime transport.
Among its nine investments to date are ECOsubsea, a leading provider of eco-friendly hull-cleaning and biofouling detection for the shipping industry, and Spinergie, which uses big data analytics to reduce fuel consumption in the maritime transport industry.
It has also invested in BlueNav, which converts boats propelled by combustion engines into hybrid electric boats, and OptoScale, which provides real-time fish biomass measurement, health assessment and sea lice counting. The fund aims to grow the number of investments to between 20 and 25 companies.

The fund initially targeted EUR120m of investments when it launched in September 2021 in scientific partnership with the French ocean research institute Ifremer, and has now reached EUR170m.
This makes it the largest venture capital fund in the world investing for the regeneration of ocean health, according to Swen Capital Partners.
More than 85% of the backers are European or US institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign funds and family offices.
French investors including the insurance firms Macif and Maif, banking group Credit Mutuel Arkea and the French Public Investment Bank are among the recent investors in the strategy.
The fund invests in innovative companies, primarily startups, in areas such as sustainable aquaculture, ocean data, plant and cell-based seafood, single-use plastic alternatives, renewable marine energies, and the decarbonisation of maritime transport.
Among its nine investments to date are ECOsubsea, a leading provider of eco-friendly hull-cleaning and biofouling detection for the shipping industry, and Spinergie, which uses big data analytics to reduce fuel consumption in the maritime transport industry.
It has also invested in BlueNav, which converts boats propelled by combustion engines into hybrid electric boats, and OptoScale, which provides real-time fish biomass measurement, health assessment and sea lice counting. The fund aims to grow the number of investments to between 20 and 25 companies.

An Abrdn spokesperson said the fund will close on 29 March as part of Abrdn's fund consolidation programme, which was announced last year.
Abrdn is merging or closing over 100 funds which are 'subscale or not aligned with [its] core strengths', according to a statement last year.
'The consolidation programme is reducing duplication, simplifying our product offering, freeing up resources and will deliver a product set that is better aligned to our key strengths and to client demands,' read the statement.
Abrdn did not respond to Citywire Selector's questions regarding the specific reasons for closing its UK sustainable equity strategy. The fund has hovered between EUR31m and EUR44m over the past three years and had EUR39.8m in assets as of February 2023.
The fund only had two months of notably positive net flows in 2022, EUR717k in February and EUR3m in March, whereas the rest of the year saw minimal net inflows of around EUR70,000 or outflows of up to EUR891k.
The fund's total returns dipped to -17.55% over 2022, whereas the average fund in the Morningstar UK Flex-Cap Equity lost 11.69%. The fund also didn't beat its peers in 2021, when it had modest gains of 8.43% compared to the category's 16.33%.
Morningstar Direct analysis of the fund also highlights the fund's fee level, which at 1.69% is in the costliest quartile of its category where the average is 1.13%, as well as its lower-than-average manager retention rate.
The fund is currently managed by Andrew Millington, who has been on the strategy since 2018, and Samantha Brownlee, who joined in 2020.",https://citywireselector.com/news/abrdn-closes-sustainable-equity-fund/a2412346,1

and Aggregate Bond
funds.
Wall also assumes Weller's role as head of global FX, with his LinkedIn indicating Wall took over the position this month. He joined JPM AM in 2020, having previously been a portfolio manager at Jupiter.
Weller, meanwhile, joined JPM AM in 2014 having previously worked on alpha strategies at BlackRock. It is understood that he has now left the group.
Wall replaces Weller on all the funds, working alongside the existing portfolio managers, who are Myles Bradshaw, Iain Stealey, Andreas Michalitsianos, Seamus Mac Gorain and Linda Raggi. Cary Fitzgerald is also a named manager on the Global Short Duration Bond fund. All the managers bar Mac Gorain, who is Citywire + rated, are A-rated.
The largest of the three funds now co-run by Wall is the $2.86bn JPM Aggregate Bond fund. The JPM Global Short Duration Bond fund has $614m in assets, while the JPM Global Aggregate Bond fund has $364m.
JPM AM confirmed that Wall has taken over as head of global FX strategy within its global fixed income, currency and commodities group.

The Schroder ISF European Large Cap
fund, which is overseen by Nicholette MacDonald-Brown, will be rolled into the Schroder ISF European Sustainable Equity
fund on 19 April, according to a shareholder notice published last month.
MacDonald-Brown, who is head of European blend equities at Schroders, also runs the European Sustainable Equity fund.
Scott MacLennan had co-run this fund but was moved to oversee its global equivalent, Schroder ISF Global Sustainable Growth, following the departure of Katherine Davidson last summer.
Schroders said the two funds in this most recent merger operate with similar mandates, albeit with a higher sustainability requirement for the receiving fund.
When looking at the crossover of the two funds, Schroders expects to have to remove around 19% of net assets from the European Large Cap fund, as they don't meet the requirements of the sustainable fund.
In announcing the merger, the group has opted to move the larger strategy, the EUR152m European Large Cap fund, into a strategy with a smaller asset base, as the European Sustainable Equity fund had EUR71m in assets at the end of December 2022.
A spokesperson for Schroders confirmed the planned merger and said MacDonald-Brown would remain as lead manager for the consolidated fund.
Both funds sit within Citywire's Equity - Europe Blend sector. Over the three years to the end of February 2023, the average return in this 610-strong peer group was 22.6%. This is while the Schroder ISF European Sustainable Equity fund returned 28.9% and the Schroder ISF European Large Cap returned 16.1%.",https://citywireselector.com/news/schroders-rolls-euro-large-cap-fund-into-smaller-esg-vehicle/a2413137,5

The UK-based investment boutique opted to impose measures on the Redwheel Nissay Japan Focus
fund in May 2021 to allow the lead manager Yasuaki Kinoshita to continue to invest without compromising his process.
The closure was imposed when the fund passed more than $400m in assets, which then rose to a peak of $441m in September 2021 as existing investors topped up allocations. However, the strategy has experienced a steady decline and currently sits at $175m (PS142m), according to Morningstar data to the end of February 2023.
According to a shareholder note, which was dated 23 January, the fund was reopened to investors on 30 January. No rationale was given for the decision. Redwheel was contacted for further comment but had not responded at the time of publication.
The decline in assets coincided with a tough period of performance for the strategy. On a three-year absolute basis, the Redwheel Nissay Japan Focus fund returned 6.8% in Japanese yen terms, while the Topix TR rose 41.7% over the same period, according to Morningstar.
Much of the under-performance appears localised to the last 12 months, as the fund lost 11.08% over this short timeframe, while the index climbed 8.52% at the same time.",https://citywireselector.com/news/redwheel-reopens-struggling-japan-fund-after-assets-halve/a2413188,2

fund, has stepped away from the strategy.
Platt stepped down from the fund on 1 February, handing over his responsibilities to co-portfolio managers Matt Franklin and AA-rated Shalin Shah.
He will continue to lead the fixed income division at Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), focusing on strategic positioning and developing the established team.
Platt had been a named manager on the fund since 1999. He joined RLAM in 1985 and became head of fixed interest in 1992.
Shah and Franklin have managed the fund alongside Platt since January 2022. They also work together on several other RLAM mandates, including the Sustainable Sterling fund.
Shah joined the firm's fixed income team in 2005 and has been a deputy manager on the fund since 2015, while Franklin joined the sterling credit team in 2014.
The Royal London Corporate Bond fund is a popular holding in multi-asset funds, according to Morningstar.
At least five UK investment firms, including Hargreaves Lansdown, Prudential Unit Trusts and T Bailey, own the strategy in their portfolios.
In an update, Hargreaves Lansdown senior investment analyst Hal Cook said the transition to new leadership on the fund appeared to have been 'well managed', leading the platform to keep it on its wealth shortlist.
In a challenging environment for fixed income, the fund lost 9.9% in the three years to the end of February, besting an average return of -14% in Citywire's Sterling Corporate Bond sector. It ranks 26th out of 102 in the peer group over the period.

The appointment comes as Citywire + rated Keith Ney has left Carmignac for personal reasons. Ney had risen through the ranks at the French fund house, which included running its credit desk and being handed a role on its flagship Patrimoine
fund in 2021.
It is understood management of Patrimoine, which currently has EUR7.5bn in assets, will now sit with Ney's former co-managers Rose Ouahba and David Older.
New recruit Hirsch will co-manage the Carmignac Portfolio Patrimoine Europe
fund, which has EUR707m in assets. He takes over from Ney in running the mixed allocation strategy's fixed income element, macro overlay, risk management and portfolio construction.
He will also join Carmignac's strategic investment committee and provide market convictions and top-down macroeconomic analysis to the firm's investment team.
Prior to Hirsch's arrival on 3 July, Ney's responsibilities will be managed by portfolio manager Marie-Anne Allier. Mark Denham will continue to manage the equity element of the Carmignac Portfolio Patrimoine Europe fund.
The long shadow of Edouard Carmignac
Hirsch has spent nearly 24 years in the finance industry, including at Goldman Sachs, Man GLG and Fulcrum Asset Management.
He most previously co-managed the Ruffer Total Return Intl fund , which has returned 30.6% over a three-year period ending February 2023. This makes it the second best performing fund in the Citywire Mixed Assets - Absolut Return EUR sector, where the average total return over the same period is 0.2%.
The Carmignac Portfolio Patrimoine Europe fund, in contrast, has had a more average performance relative to its peers in the Citywire - Flexible EUR category. Having returned 12% over a three-year period ending February 2023 whereas the average fund returned 3.5%, the fund is ranked 543 out of 2,171 strategies.
Edouard Carmignac, chairman and CIO of Carmignac said: 'Jacques is an experienced portfolio manager who has demonstrated his ability to deliver strong performance throughout various market conditions, including the volatility of recent years. His arrival exhibits our continued ability to attract some of the best talent in our industry.
'I'd also like to thank Keith Ney for his significant contribution to the business and wish him all the best for the future.'
The addition of Hirsch, as well as Ney's exit, come at a time of recent change for the fund house. The group bolstered its alternatives division last month with two senior hires from Candriam.

As a result of the closures, portfolio manager and head of environmental solutions Rhys Petheram is leaving the firm after 17 years.
The PS13.9m (EUR15m) Global Ecology Bond
and the PS15.7m (EUR17.8m) Global Ecology Diversified
funds will both close on 6 April.
'Following a detailed review as part of our ongoing product rationalisation process, including client feedback, it has been concluded that these two funds are not aligned with client demand,' a Jupiter spokesperson said. 'Liquidating these funds is in the best interests of investors.'
Petheram has worked at Jupiter since 2006. The firm thanked him for developing the asset manager's fixed income and environmental solutions strategies during his tenure.
The shake-up of the division comes two years after Charlie Thomas left Jupiter to join Edentree as its chief investment officer.
The Global Ecology Bond fund was only launched for Petheram in February last year. The fund has lost a disappointing 11.7% over 12 months, even worse than the sector average loss of 8.5%.
The Global Ecology Diversified fund, which Petheram managed alongside Jon Wallace, has lost 5.1% over the past year, compared with a sector average loss of 2.8%. Over three years the strategy is down 1.7%, as the peer group has returned 3.6%.
Wallace also manages Jupiter's flagship PS688m Ecology fund, which has been a far stronger performer.

Commenting on the closure of the latest fund, Philipp Freise, co-head of KKR European Private Equity, said: 'KKR has been investing in Europe for nearly 25 years and we believe the opportunity today has never been greater.

Destribats left the firm in February 2023, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson confirmed.
According to her LinkedIn profile, Destribats first worked with the firm as a summer analyst for three months in 2011, before joining the firm full-time the following year.
Destribats worked her way up through the ranks and was promoted to managing director of global equity in January 2022, a position she held for just over a year.
Sullivan, vice president on the global equity team within fundamental equity, has assumed Destribat's research responsibilities. This includes stepping onto the Global Millennials Equity strategy alongside Alexis Deladerriere and Nathan Lin.
Sullivan joined the firm in 2021, bringing with her 10 years of equity research experience, and will work closely with Deladerriere and Lin, who will continue to serve as portfolio managers for the fund.
The Global Millennials Equity fund returned 19.3% over three-years to the end of February 2023, compared to the sector average of 19.1%.

In doing so he will relinquish his portfolio manager status on the following funds:
$2bn JPM Greater China .

Replacing Wang on the three strategies named above is Li Tan, who is a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager. Jiang, who had co-run the portfolios with Wang, remains in place on all her existing portfolios.

The Paris Commercial Court has said the asset manager must turn over communications relating to its side-pocketed funds to aid an expert report designed to gauge the damage to investors in funds found to be holding illiquid assets.
It relates to a case brought by a group of investors, known as Collectif Porteurs H2O, which had sought around 4,000 documents designed to showcase the decision-making process between the suspension, side-pocketing and repayment plans relating to H2O's main strategies.
Gerard Maruin, president of the collective group, said the expert panel - which is led by Eric Pinon, the former chief executive of the Association Francaise de la Gestion Financiere - has not been given access to all required documents.
This saw the Paris Commercial Court announce on 30 March that H2O would be ordered to pay a fine of EUR20,000 per day until all of the documents had been supplied.
This includes email exchanges between German businessman Windhorst as well as H2O's chief executive officer Bruno Crastes and chief investment officer Vincent Chailley.
Pinon had been expected to complete his report on the communications by 31 May but the delay in receiving this material means this is now unlikely. It is understood the completion of the report would underpin a large aspect of the collective's next legal steps regarding their exposure to H2O funds.
When speaking to Citywire France, H2O said it has provided more than 30,000 pieces of evidence and documentation and that the documents being sought by the collective do not actually exist.
