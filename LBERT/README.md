# Project
LBERT: Long-text classification using BERT models

## Scripts (python):
1. Analyze similarity between classes to reduce the number of classes.
2. Train the model using auxiliary functions to handle texts longer than 510 words.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Note:
1. The code implemented in this script follows the ["bert for longer texts"](https://github.com/mim-solutions/bert_for_longer_texts/tree/6df96752f8f7ca8c07687f5c687e371913e53605) repository, with some modifications to apply it to multiple classes.
2. The data is saved in the repository.
