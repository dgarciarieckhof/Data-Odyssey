# From Raw Audio to Insights

Imagine having hours of interview recordings, podcasts, or meeting discussions. How can you quickly convert this amount of information into digestible, actionable reports? This is where an automated audio interview pipeline can be a game-changer.

This pipeline is designed to handle raw audio (or even video) files, transcribe the content, identify and separate speakers, analyze the transcript for key insights, and then compile a structured report. The best part? You can do all of this with minimal manual effort, without listening thousands of hours of audio.

## Project Overview
This is a project I developed to simplify audio analysis. It‚Äôs designed to take audio from interviews or any spoken format, transcribe it into text, perform speaker diarization to identify individual speakers, generate insights using a language model (LLM), and finally compile the results into a structured report. This pipeline could save hours of manual transcription and analysis, making it ideal for researchers, journalists, and business analysts alike.

## Pipeline Workflow
Here's a high-level overview of each step in the pipeline:

1) Gather Interviews: The pipeline starts with a dataset of interviews or spoken audio. These can be audio or video files (if video, only the audio will be processed).

2) Identify Pending Interviews: The system automatically detects interviews that haven't been processed yet, preparing them for the next steps.

3) Download Audio: If the audio needs to be downloaded (e.g., from a video source), this step will handle the extraction. Using tools like yt-dlp, the pipeline converts video to audio format for further processing.

4) Transcription and Diarization: This step is where the magic happens. The pipeline transcribes the audio and performs speaker diarization, a process that identifies different speakers within the audio, making the transcript more organized and structured.

5) LLM Analysis: Once transcribed, the text is fed into a Large Language Model (LLM), which analyzes the content to extract summaries, key themes, or specific insights. Think of this as having a mini-research assistant that scans the text and pulls out what‚Äôs important.

6) Generate Final Report: All the processed information is compiled into a final report, ready for review, distribution, or further analysis.

*Footnote: This pipeline efficiently processes audio interviews, providing structured insights for researchers, journalists, and analysts.*

## Technology Stack
For this project, I used a variety of tools and libraries to handle different parts of the pipeline:

- Python: The core programming language for building the pipeline.
- Kedro: A framework for building robust, maintainable data pipelines.
- yt-dlp: A video download library used to convert video to audio when needed.
- Speech-to-Text Models: Used for high-accuracy transcription.
- Diarization Models: Distinguishes between speakers within the audio.
- Large Language Model (LLM): The brains of the pipeline, analyzing transcriptions to produce summaries and insights.

## Practical Example
Let‚Äôs say you have an hour-long interview with a group of experts discussing industry trends. With this pipeline, you can feed in the interview audio, and it will:

Identify different speakers, making it easier to attribute quotes.
Summarize the key points each speaker made, flagging trends or insights.
Generate a final report with all the insights neatly organized.
What could take you hours to transcribe and analyze now happens in minutes, letting you focus on deeper analysis rather than data wrangling.

## Why This Pipeline Matters
In fields like journalism and research, the ability to quickly analyze spoken data is crucial. But transcription alone is only part of the puzzle. This pipeline goes beyond mere transcription by separating speakers, performing text analysis, and producing summaries‚Äîan end-to-end solution for deriving value from audio data.

Imagine the time saved and the insights gained when you can process dozens of interviews or discussions in a fraction of the time. This pipeline not only helps you process audio data but also helps you make sense of it while mapping the sources to corroborate facts based on the audio.

## Next Steps
This pipeline is designed with flexibility in mind. Future improvements could include:

- Adding another layer of customization for different type of reports.
- Integrating with real-time transcription for live events.
- Fine-tuning the LLM for specific industries to enhance insight generation.
