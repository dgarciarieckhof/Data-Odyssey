# Project
This project aims to facilitate the understanding of topics discussed in monetary policy notes released by the Peruvian Central Bank. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, it processes PDF and text data, extracts readable sentences, and implements topic modeling and text classification using contextual word embeddings.

## Jupyter Notebook (python):
1. **Data Acquisition**: Automatically download and save monetary policy notes from the Peruvian Central Bank website.
2. **Data Processing**: Utilize regular expressions to process PDF and text data into readable sentences.
3. **Topic Modeling**: Showcase the implementation of topic modeling techniques using contextual word/sentence embeddings to identify and analyze key topics discussed in the monetary policy notes.
4. **Text Classification**: Implement text classification using contextual word embeddings with BETO (BERT in Spanish), evaluate the results using relevant metrics, and analyze word attribution.

## Note:
1. Code for the implementation contained in a .py file that you import into your notebook.
2. The data is saved in the repository.
