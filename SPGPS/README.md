# Project
Spanning Groups: Building Relationships From Contextual Data

## Jupyter Notebook (python):
1. Download and save the components of the S&P 500 from Wikipedia and their corresponding descriptions.
2. Create sentence embeddings based on the descriptions for each company.
3. Create a set of functions/classes for the end-user to utilize.
4. Showcase the methodology and results in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Note:
1. The code for implementing steps 1 and 2 is contained in a .py file that should be run prior to using the notebook.
2. The data is saved in the repository.
