[Enhancing a Pairs Trading strategy with the application of Machine Learning](https://premio-vidigal.inesc.pt/pdf/SimaoSarmentoMSc-resumo.pdf)

## Jupyter Notebook (python):
1. Download and save your universe of stocks (use 200-300 shares) (Yahoo finance or Polygon).
2. Implement Section III: Proposed Pairs Selection Framework (A, B, and Section C).
3. Create a set of functions/class for the end-user to make use of.
4. Showcase the new Pairs Selection Framework in a Jupyter Notebook and display visualizations of the clusters and pairs (Plotly/Dash).

## Note:
1. Code for the implementation contained in a .py file that you import into your notebook.
2. The data is saved in the repository.
